*this is the only note in my vault that will break one of my [[creative constraints]] of lowercase.*

iâ€™ve always preferred typing in lowercase in general as i feel that it appears more approachable and friendly. however, i also realise that there are times where normal capitalisation actually is helpful and also works, at least in a more formal setting. in this case of note taking and personal knowledge management, i too one to have a consistent and cohesive system from the way i type all the way to the system itself.

here is a really funny reddit about capitalisation which actually describes the whole situation really well.

`Capital letters? Are they necessary? Which do you prefer: "help your uncle Jack off the horse" or "help your uncle jack off a horse"? Your choice.`
