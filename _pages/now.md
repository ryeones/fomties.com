*welcome to my [[now page]], which is basically a place to get to know what i'm up to in the quickest way possible - first started by derek sivers, and later adopted by tobias van schneider and many others. if you happen to have a website, [you should have one too](https://nownownow.com/p/0KL9)*
## monthly updates

### 7/25
- been awhile since iâ€™ve updated this page
### 6/25

### 5/25

### 4/25

### 3/25

- from end of feb to march, i was transitioning from focusing on school competitions to club competitions as our season is beginning soon. at the same time, i have also overtaken the role of managing the social media of my club, which i am enjoying having the free rein while also having more things in my portfolio!
- i recently went to jb with my partner again during our recess week, and i used the time there to film for one of my assignments (will update here once i upload on youtube). i am hoping that through taking the time to film and edit a proper short film, it would sort of rejevunate my discipline to start creating content again. nonetheless, its been a week of exploring and enjoying so far.
- i recently started a side gig for this financial advisor that i was introduced to, basically i am suppose to help him create slide decks for his presentations, and would roughly get paid $200 per deck - honestly a very good deal, and at the same time i am expanding my network a little.
- the biggest news of the year so far, and the month, would be that i got an internship. not any internship, but an internship that i wanted. its not glamorous because of the name of the agency, nor is the pay something that is very competitive, but the fact that i am able to work for someone that i have followed in the social media space for quite awhile now. i will be writing a newsletter about it in the coming few days.

### 2/25

- its been about a month since i posted about my video, sharing that i would like to stat focusing on content creation. honestly since then, i was back in my mind again, fearing about how others would think of me, which eventually led to me only planning videos and not actually filming them. i am hoping that soon i would be able to start working on them again as i am basically running out of time.
- we have also just concluded our ivp competition and after 18 long years of school competitions, i ended my final season with a bronze medal. i would definitely have preferred ending it with a gold but i guess that is what the big man up there has planned for me.
    - moving forward, i also am starting to focus on my final semester of school as it is currently in full swing now, hence i am trying to balance my commitment to my studies, while also hoping to make some progress with my agency that i am trying to build in the short to medium term, â€£
- the recent chinese new year was also a good break, however i have to start getting back on track, ensuring that i set out to do is on track as well.
- i am going through the first half of my final semester of university, kinda enjoying how it goes, trying to keep tracking on school but not being really hard up on grades either (not like i was ever so)

### 1/25

- i posted a video telling my story - struggles of being lost in my twenties and the current stage of my life, i was honestly quite scared before posting it, and to be honest, it didnâ€™t do as well as i expected (at least on tiktok), but what was more important was the messages and support i received, mostly from friends but that was more than enough.
    
    - hopefully iâ€™ll be able to take this in my stride and start focusing a little more on building a personal brand, but as of this writing, i am still pretty confused
    - heres the video if anyoneâ€™s interested

- school has also recently restarted and iâ€™m into my final semester! iâ€™m currently taking some modules from the media communication faculty such as digital storytelling and user experience, so hopefully through them iâ€™ll be able to deepen my understanding of the subject and translate the skills into building my personal brand, as well as [euscape](https://www.notion.so/euscape-e973639d3e3b4416b86912f05a715709?pvs=21)
    

# 2024

### 12/24

- at the time of this writing, i have completed the first three weeks of cs50, but all of a sudden i hate this yearning to start again on the brand that i always wanted to build. i decided to put a pause on my coding course (unless i find the time during the day) and instead work on the brand that i hope to be building. i donâ€™t want to publicly share on my personal page as i wanted to try organically growing it instead, hence if youâ€™re one of the few that is lucky to stumble across this page, do check it out, i appreciate the support.
- more information on the brand as well as our social media pages can be found here [euscape](https://www.notion.so/euscape-e973639d3e3b4416b86912f05a715709?pvs=21)!
- started the month off with a trip to jb with the bois for our pre season cohesion
    - all i can say it was a blast and iâ€™m still working on the edit for the video
- going off for another trip with j and her friendsâ€¦to jb
- i also recently started a newsletter for my brand, and i am proud to say i have 3 subscribers, that are definitely not my friends as i have not publicly shared anything that iâ€™m doing on my main accounts
    - you can check out the newsletter here
        - [euscape by soffcopy](https://euscape.soffcopy.com)
    - i also intend to start writing newsletter for my personal brand
        - if navigating your life in your twenties as an ambivert is something along your alley
        - do check out [fihtus by ryeones](http://blog.ryeones.com)
- for the past few weeks iâ€™ve been slowly applying for jobs within the creative and marketing sector as that is where my interests and passion intersects
    - starting to feel the sting of it as i have zero internships and am graduating soon, but i shall not give up!
    - something else that is far in the distance, i do hope to start a social media agency, focusing on helping small creators and brands share their stories authentically
        - have just set up the landing site for it at [www.soffcopy.com](http://www.soffcopy.com)

### 11/24

- i had dinner with j and her sister and they wanted to eat hothideout
    - honestly it was pretty alright, i guess it had a little something different from the way they cooke compared to other mala tang stores
    - but its still overhyped (she wouldnâ€™t like this ðŸ˜…)
- had dinner with j and her other close friends, and this was our very first time meeting everyone as well
- iâ€™ve more or less wrapped up the semester as iâ€™m writing this, but still have a couple of submissions for this up coming weeks

- for this winter, i am challenging myself by taking [**cs50's introduction to computer science**](https://www.notion.so/cs50-s-introduction-to-computer-science-142c346f79ef809186e5c1779e78aea1?pvs=21) and am continuing to learn how to use blender
    - i recently submitted my very first problem set and its suppose to be a rendition of icytowers
    - totally still a work in progress but here it is [icytower (cs50 - problem set 0 - wip)](https://www.notion.so/icytower-cs50-problem-set-0-wip-68103aac8fb8450b98fe4dc0bbaec317?pvs=21)

### 10/24

- division 1 is over and nemesis emerged as champinos for the league table, and second runners up for the playoffs
- sunig is officially over and nus lost out to ntu in the finals.
    - lots of things to be happy about, but even more things to regret
    - here is what i wrote about it [**a season of growth and reflection**](https://www.notion.so/a-season-of-growth-and-reflection-d756c214bbeb4586a58162557e144be0?pvs=21)
- this semester so far has been really enjoyable, iâ€™ve dabbled into branding more so than i would have on my own time, though it still requires the same tenacity that architecture requires in studio, i think being able to approach it from an enjoyment point of view really makes things a lot more manageable
- j and i went back to ikoi again to celebrate the end of sunig as well as division 1
    - we also had an impromptu trip to jb again during the long weekend that we had
    - this time it was much more enjoyable since it wasnâ€™t during examinations period
        - we still spent most of our time in the airbnb
    - we also watched the brawl stars world championships together
- i also attended my cousins wedding, what a beautiful couple they are

### 09/24

- have been doing pretty alright in division 1, but always feel like i can being doing much more
- iâ€™ve also recently been removed from the national team after 5 years and it has been weighing on my mind quite a lot
    - to be honest i cried like a bitch when i first heard the news
    - nonetheless, iâ€™m trying to focus and spend more time on other things now that i have that extra free time on my hands
- we went on our first trip to jb during our recess week, it wasnâ€™t the most enjoyable since we didnâ€™t have the capacity to treat it as a proper vaycation
    - spent most of our time in our airbnb studying
- ended the month off by celebrating the birthdays of some of the bois
    - chatted at a rooftop at funan mall, truly is some vibes

### 08/24

- im in my final year of architecture school, but after deciding against taking masters, i am now able to freely choose the modules i want to take
    - i have decided to take modules that interest me or would propel me in my very young and fihtus career
        - moduless such as personal branding, visual communication, financial literacy and career catalyst amoung others
- letâ€™s call the girl iâ€™m dating j, because iâ€™m too lazy to type the girl and it just makes sentence structuring reall
    - we celebrated the start of school by going to a japanese buffet that i love
    - its called ikoi and its pretty cheap assuming that youâ€™re just there for the sashimi
- attended my first ever branding class and though it was pretty new to me, iâ€™m really enjoying every second of it
- iâ€™m also taking up sketching classes this semester, it seems pretty chill so far but i guess the main point of that module is not to see who is the best at technical sketching, but how imaginative we can be by communicating our ideas visually
- sunig preparations are also in full force, and our team seems to be in pretty good shape for the upcoming compeitions

### 07/24

    - really enjoyable trip overall despite our final day plans being cancelled totally because i had food poisoning
- starting to enjoy national training again, but seems like there are new players added to the squad, perhaps some kind of restructuring happening soon
- spent most of my time updating my notion set up, reading self help books as well as playing brawl stars

### 05/24

### 04/24

- an entire semester has flown by, and i basically submit one of the worst projects iâ€™ve done in my 3 years
    - nonetheless, i think iâ€™m more thankful that it has ended rather than whether i did well
    - you can check out [portfolio](https://www.notion.so/portfolio-ebf01fb9582d4aa49b5e0cc126866198?pvs=21) for the project once iâ€™ve found the time to update it
- we had our first meeting with our sponsors for the season (nemesis and reds) and honestly the hype videos film looked pretty lit

- for the first time, we went out to somewhere further from school to eat
    - it was her birthday so i guess we canâ€™t just eat at school
        - we had bagels at holland village
        - the bagel was pretty good but price was pricey too

### 03/24

- iâ€™ve been meeting this girl almost everyday, spending time in our room doing work together
- studio work still hasnâ€™t been easy, and honestly have been really bad sleep cycles the past few days
    - having to stay up to come up with ideas, and make models

    - we recently also had our local test series in selection for the upcoming aimag competition

### 01/24

- its my birthday month but as always its pretty lack lustre for the most part
