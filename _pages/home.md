# your 20s is messy. but you’re not behind.



*everyone’s pretending to have it figured out.*

- dropouts running 6-figure agencies from dubai penthouses
    
- frat boys flexing lambos from “ecom wins”
    
- founders at 19, burnout by 23, “coaching” by 24.

what they don’t show: *the late nights, the panic, the doubt.*

you’re **not behind**. you’re just **not faking it.**

**fomties isn’t about the highlight reel. it’s about being real.**

most of us didn’t grow up with silicon valley dads or media connections.

we started with weekend side hustles. dming strangers. 

we balanced _living a life we’re proud of_  - not one built for us.

and still, we show up. we build. we try.

even when it’s messy. even when we fall short.

**this is a space for that.**
