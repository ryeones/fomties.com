## **figuring out your twenties is a mess. but you’re not behind.**




**everyone’s pretending to have it figured out.**

- dropouts running 6-figure agencies from penthouses in dubai.
    
- frat boys posting lambos from “ecom wins.”
    
- founders at 19, burnout by 23, “coaching” by 24.

what they don’t show: *the late nights, the panic, the doubt.*

you’re **not behind**. you’re just **not faking it.**

**fomties isn’t about the highlight reel. it’s about the real.**

because most of us didn’t grow up with silicon valley dads or media connections.

we started from weekend side hustles. dming strangers.

balancing _living a life we’re proud of_  - not one that was built for us.

and still - we show up. we build. we try. even if we end up "failing"

**this is a space for that.**
