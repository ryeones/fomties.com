**Guiding Principles Development Process**

This is a thorough process that will typically take multiple days. Make it a weekend project or clear some time over the course of a week. The return on this investment will be massive.

  

**START HERE:**

  

- **Conceptual Approach**  
    If you don't know what you value, study how you spend your time ‚Äî what you gravitate toward naturally. Then assess how you feel afterward.

- Was it rewarding?
- Do you feel grateful?
- Do you feel indifferent?
- Do you feel regret?
- How could you have spent that time better?

‚Äî  

- This afterglow reveals a great deal about what you value.

- ‚ÄúThe most terrifying fact about the universe is not that it's hostile, but that it's indifferent. If we can come to terms with this indifference, then our existence as a species can have genuine meaning. However vast the darkness, we must supply our own light.‚Äù - Stanley Kubrick  
      
    We must create our own meaning.  
    Meaning comes from responsibility.  
    No responsibility, no meaning, no purpose.  
      
    Want meaning and purpose? Accept responsibility for things that make a difference.  
    Use what you know about your values to choose your responsibilities. Put yourself in a position where other people can depend on you. Then don't let them down. Over-deliver.  
      
    This does not mean ignoring yourself or your own needs.  
    You need to build yourself as well so you have the strength and resources to deliver on your purpose.

**NEXT:**

  

- **1. Reflect**  
    **First, we look at actual experiences, actions, and interactions to see what they reveal.  
    **Write out lists for each question...  
    **Situations & Context**

- **Where do good things in life tend to happen to me? In what types of spaces and environments?**
- **Where do problems arise?**

- **With whom do good things in life happen frequently?**

- **With whom do problems arise?**

- **Who has had the biggest positive impact on my life? What have they done that was special or meaningful?**

**Standout Experiences**

- **Biggest wins and best moments over the past several years?**

- **What am I most grateful for over the past several years?**

- **What made me most happy, satisfied, and/or proud over the past several years?**

- **What do I regret most over the past several years?**

- **What bummed me out the most? Could I have done more to avoid it? Does it still bother me? Should I just let it go and move on? Should I dig deeper into it to understand it better?**

- **Biggest challenge(s) I overcame over the past several years?**

- **How did I rise to that/those challenges? How did I change in the process?**

**Learning from routine experiences**

- **In a typical average week, are there often-repeating moments to be grateful for?**

- **In a typical average week, are there often-repeating moments to regret?**

- **What¬†do I wish I had done more of over the past several years?**

- **What¬†do I wish I had done less of?**

- What have I learned about myself over the past several years?

- **2. Interpret**

- What patterns and feedback loops have had an impact on my life over the past several years?  
    List the Positive, helpful ones

- List the Negative, hurtful or destructive ones

- **How have the things I've chosen to pursue and spend time on influenced my level of happiness? (good and bad)**

- **What do I represent and advance in the world?**

- **What do I wish I represented and advanced in the world?**

- **How do I want to impact people around me? How far do I want that reach to extend?**

- **3. Analyze**  
    Looking over the answers to the sections above ‚Äî what does that say about me? What insights can I extract from that about what I value and where I find meaning in life?  
    Really mine these actual experiences for discoveries. What we do says a lot about ourselves that may not be obvious. Study the behaviors and observe the subsequent feelings/emotions following that behavior.

  

1. **Describe the patterns I see in my past experiences, actions, and interactions. What are the recurring elements that reappear over and over again? Probe this deeply, spend hours or even days reflecting on this (and make it a habit in life to watch for such patterns on an ongoing basis). These can be positive or negative patterns.**

2. Skim the reflections listed in the "[Reflect](https://www.notion.so/Guiding-Principles-Development-Process-8ceac07c247c44bcbab50071adc46301?pvs=21)" section above and see if any more of those reveal patterns to add to the list above.  
    ...then put an asterix (*) next to those listed above that are feedback loops, meaning they get stronger and stronger, building over time (the output from one loop pours even greater strength into the beginning of the next iteration).
3. Is there a difference between how I feel about these recurring patterned actions and events in the moment, immediately afterward, or after some time has passed?  
    Pay attention to where the subsequent feelings were positive, where they were negative, and where they changed over time (if they did not change, no problem ‚Äî don't force it).  
    Organize the list in #1 above plus any others from the [Reflect](https://www.notion.so/Guiding-Principles-Development-Process-8ceac07c247c44bcbab50071adc46301?pvs=21) & [Interpret](https://www.notion.so/Guiding-Principles-Development-Process-8ceac07c247c44bcbab50071adc46301?pvs=21) sections above onto the following linked page with these four category headings.  
    [Experiential Reaction Board](https://www.notion.so/9562dc215e994825927c05fcfeee36da?pvs=21)

- **Looking over the , what do my frequent/recurring actions and subsequent feelings/emotions say about my values and where I find meaning?**

- **Can I think of anything else that reflects or influences my values and sources of meaning?**

- What do I value and where do I find meaning based on these reflections and influences?  
    **Values**

- **Meaning**

Based on your answers and insights above, create a succinct set of bullet points for the Guiding Principles summary below...

<aside> <img src="/icons/sun_orange.svg" alt="/icons/sun_orange.svg" width="40px" /> **Guiding Principles**

  

- Value  
    Succinctly summarize what you value most in life. (Pulling from what you highlighted in the steps above). Revisit those answers to shape these bullet points. Over time, refine these to be as concise as possible.

- Purpose  
    What purpose do I serve or intend to serve?

- Who depends on me? (or will depend on me at some point)

    How I will show these Values and fulfill this Meaning in my actions

- Foundational Statement  
    Write out 3 to 5 lines on what defines your purpose in life. Really craft this, shape it into something that feels somewhat poetic. Make it as tight and succinct as possible. You will repeat this to yourself in every weekly review.  
    Example:  
 Experience the deepest threads of life through the most capable mind & body I can create.  
    Maximally love and support the people I am closest to. Empower broader circles of people with as much impact as possible.  
    Embrace, foster, and champion mindful, thoughtful, caring, and artistic values.  
    Be courageous. Be honest. Stay true.  
    Create maximum value. Be useful.
