this is related to my note on [[multiple tools, single system]]

this applies to different aspects of life. your environment, your digital tool stack etc.

for example, something iâ€™ve yet to incorporate in my life.

a place to work. a place to sleep. a place to be creative.

currently my bed room is the place i eat, sleep, play and work.

not the most ideal. hence not the most productive but i make do at the moment.

similarly, with the notes and writings i create.

i need a place to dump. a place to refine and work on the ideas. and a place to publish these ideas. 

however i also like the idea of working in public and working with the garage door open.

i like to show the messiness. because i think not enough people are showing them.

i think apple notes is a very good place to dump ideas.

iâ€™m currently looking at a place where i can continuously work these ideas.

something like obsidian. maybe.

and notion is a place for publishing. finished products in a way. it can host a simple site.

obsidian does that too, and perhaps the public sharing of the messiness is a good way to do it.

something i havenâ€™t fully thought through and considered.

at the end of the day, i donâ€™t want to be held down by shiny object syndrome and work on the work, but instead actually doing the thing.
