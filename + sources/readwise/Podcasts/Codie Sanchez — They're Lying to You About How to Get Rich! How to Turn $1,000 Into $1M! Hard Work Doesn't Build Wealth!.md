> Trust in Crisis Breeds Resonance
> Summary:
> A widespread sense of distrust in institutions, including governments, corporations, and media, causes messages that resonate on personal and collective levels to gain traction.
> This atmosphere of skepticism influences the perceived relevance of political messages, where certain leaders are able to connect deeply with the public. The dwindling viewership of major news outlets underscores the shift in trust and interest, highlighting the urgent need for authentic dialogue in today's political landscape.

> Your message has resonated really profoundly with millions and millions and millions and millions of people. You've got an audience of millions of people across all of your social media channels. It appears that you've hit culture and the zeitgeist with a particular message at a particular time. Do you spend much time reflecting on why your message is so resonant right now? That's interesting.
> Speaker 1
> It's hard right now to not think about politics in some way, shape, or form. And so I think when I think about politics today, what I really think about is who's in charge, right? And so I do think about why does one politician hit a chord? Why does one not? And I think when I think about my message, what hits me closest to home is that for some reason a message right now is feeling true for many people in the world that there's a lack of trust, Like trust in institutions, trust in governments and big corporations, in the media. You know, I saw yesterday an article about CNN, this is fascinating. How many views do you think CNN got in prime time for one week, three hour segments every day, prime time for one week in May. What do you think?

> Existential question. You know, I'm a former finance investor for 15 plus years, investment banking, asset management, who finally because COVID happened, took a little breather, realized that I didn't Want to be like the managing directors that I saw all around me and started writing stuff online. Because I wasn't doing road shows, selling investments and investing people's money for a year or whatever that was. And because of that, I started writing about the things that I do. And I kind of thought nobody liked the idea of owning laundromats and car washes and all of that. And it turns out a lot of people thought that was interesting. And I do think we kind of hit this zeitgeist of, you know, you saw it during COVID people left big cities, right? They bought houses in Cape Town or somewhere out in rural areas, right? They got away from the corporate job in office in suits and realized, God, I don't want a 75 minute commute. I maybe want a little bit of fresh air into chicken coops, a lot of chicken coops these days. And so because of that, they got interested in these small businesses, these community businesses. And so I think I got a little bit lucky in the fact that that was interesting to me. I've done it for years, I've invested in those things forever. I started writing about on the internet, and then we got a lot of views. And now all of a sudden, there are millions of people that talk about buying these small businesses, or what we call boring businesses.
