## Highlights
### id825806755

> Here’s how $PENGU will affect NFT floor prices in the short-term for those of you who care. The token launches in about 2.5 hours or so.
> (TLDR it’s a catch-22):
> 1. Launch will go well. It will be easier to claim your rewards than it was for Magic Eden.
> 2. You’ll see screenshots (from long-time Pudgy owners) of Jupiter swap quotes thanking the team for how much money they have received (for example: $60k per Pudgy Penguin NFT). Whether it’s for clout, to brag, or celebrating an emotional moment and accomplishment for holding.
> 3. Subtract that dollar amount you see in their screenshots, from the current floor price (as of the time I posted this, the floor is over $130,000 or about 33 ETH).
> 4. The new floor for claimed Penguins will be approximately $130,000 - $60,000 =$70,000, or just 17 to 18 ETH thanks to President Joe Biden pumping the price of ETH for us.
> 5. Smart traders and flippers such as Cirrus will capitalize on market inefficiencies such as people listing unclaimed Penguins at or near the new lower floor (as long as they’re not PvP’d by a troll bot who claims right before it sells). The flippers will buy, claim, cash out the tokens, then sell at the new lower floor to quickly profit. That could also add pressure to the new floor price.
> 6. The higher the price of $PENGU is, then the greater the delta is between unclaimed and claimed Pudgys. So based on my $60k per Pudgy estimate, either the unclaimed floor goes up even higher from $130k, or the claimed floor goes lower from $70k (you can flip a coin here but I’ll predict that the unclaimed floor doesn’t go up)
> 7. If the $PENGU price is at a disappointing low value, the whole NFT ecosystem will also suffer due to impatient people’s expectations not being met, despite the gap between the unclaimed and claimed floor prices being smaller.
> So that’s the catch-22. The NFTs will lose overall value in the short term regardless of $PENGU price action.
> Maybe I’m completely wrong and out-of-touch, or maybe you already knew what I’m describing and this is pointless.
> However, I just needed some engagement too so thank you for reading this far.
> ———————————————
> PS:
> Another thing to watch out for is the amount of liquidity in the Solana liquidity pools that is available to absorb multiple large $60k dumps of claims.
> With large volume like that coming, people will add one-sided pools of SOL and eventually two-sided SOL-PENGU to absorb these sales and grow their PENGU position while earning fees. There’s also the option of one-sided PENGU pools to absorb ETH if the price of PENGU goes up.
> The fees peak in the first few hours and then start to drop off as volume decreases and more strategic liquidity entries come in, which could discourage some providers and they may sell their cheaper position and move on.
> The Solana memecoin community likes to always chase the new flashy thing whether it is for quick profit or to earn liquidity pool fees, so the volume of large market cap memecoins naturally flattens out over time.
