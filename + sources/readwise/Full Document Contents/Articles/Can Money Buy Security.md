can money buy security is a state of being free from danger and threat from a young age I was taught that I needed money to survive and that money brought security with money I was Secure I was safe however despite how much I saved it never seemed to be enough for what my mind spoils into a series of what-ifs 

what if I get a chronic illness and can't work anymore what if my parents get sick what if my child needs to go to a special needs school or an overseas University education but if all of this were to happen at the same time this is my inner Storyteller on steroids we're putting itself at infinitum I had my first Awakening when I realized how strange it was to only attain peace 

if I had all the money to ensure that I would remain secure even if everything were to go wrong in my life overthinking at this way fat and endless look of worry and continuous struggle within I begin to realize that as long as my in a Storyteller continued to be driven by fear judgment and despair no amount of money would ever be enough I saw that I had a choice to move towards joy and healing

there were brightly colored lanterns folks playing on the fiddle singing and Mary Making which made for the most festive atmosphere and then an elderly gentleman Kim Waltzing through the door with a huge smile on his face while holding out a bunch of carrots with their Roots still drooping with soil Happy Thanksgiving hero in our conversations he described his

of the many kinds of security one that is externally oriented quest for happiness maybe we could turn the question around instead of only finding Security in money what do we really want to find security in Beyond money could we also find Safety and Security in being part of and belonging to a community with Rich culture talents and gifts could we also find security in the Peace 

of our own minds money can purchase a limited extent of security however it can never buy true peace of mind instead of fixating on the security that money can bring throughout someone explosive means I want to begin building Security in regenerative ways that reinforce virtuous feedback loops
