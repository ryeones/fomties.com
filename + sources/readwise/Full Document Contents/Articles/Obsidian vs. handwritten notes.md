- Real Title: Obsidian vs. handwritten notes
- Category: #Source/articles
- Summary: Digital notes are easier to manage than handwritten ones because they can be stored safely and searched quickly, even in large quantities. Editing and linking notes is also much simpler in digital formats, allowing for better organization and less duplication. While writing by hand can feel satisfying, digital note-taking is more practical for building and maintaining a knowledge base.

##### Backup

How do you ensure your notes have integrity / persistence if you take them on paper? Handling them without proper care will lead to degradation over time since the oils in your skin will affect paper, and even moisture in the air itself has a effect, unless you're laminating everything?

Digital mediums also have things such as bit rot, but there are countermeasures for that. Even without them, it's very easy to have multiple copies both onsite and in the cloud, so even if one goes bad there are fallbacks.

##### Search and Recall capability

For paper notes, search time is going to increase as the number of notes do. You probably wouldn't notice with any small number of notes, even going up to a few hundred. But getting into the thousands and tens-of-thousands it becomes a problem.

##### Format Flexibility

Some of the issues above, notably search and recall, and needing physical space to store notes, is why most infamous paper based note systems have an element of *atomicity* about them (i.e. keeping notes short). Physical space is obvious (i.e. smaller the notes, less physical space required). But also the shorter the notes, the more highly indexed content can be (to facilitate linking / avoid duplication).

There are significantly less restrictions on digital. Computers are able to do billions of operations a second (Ghz) and so you can have long format notes without significant impact on search / recall. While short notes are still great for the purposes of linking, they're not mandatory on digital.

##### Avoiding duplication

Duplication is the enemy of all data stores because it messes up link integrity.

Say if you've just thought of something and you want to add it as note `D` into your note store. Little do you know you already have a note with very similar content (`C`) in your vault which has it's own links (to `A` and `B`). The vault has 1000+ notes in there you don't always remember them all / have them on your mind all the time.

If your notes were paper based, there would be no way to prevent duplication till after the fact. That is, *best case* you would write note `D`, then assign it some identifier (e.g. dewey decimal number, zettel ID, etc) and go to file it, then realize you already had note `C` and have to make edits. Worst case the identifier you assign is different enough for `D` that you file it without coming across `C` at all... now you have 2 notes with similar content which can have links pointing at completely different places.

This manifests as cognitive overhead, because you'll remember you took a note about `C` when the content is actually in `D` or vice versa.

In digital systems this isn't a problem. Provided you have some form of naming convention and/or alias notes properly, all you have to do is create your notes by triggering the quick switcher and typing in whatever you want to call your note (`D`). If a note with the same name (or alias) already exists, it will show as a result, in which case you can just open the existing one, bypassing all the shenanigans outlined above.

##### Editing

If you write notes in pen and make an error... out comes the white out, or worse, you red ‚ùå the entire paragraph and start over. Furthermore it doesn't have to be a spelling error, you could add information later / or link to another note that recontextualizes things and requires you to rewrite stuff for it to make sense.

Digital note taking makes both real-time editing and retroactive refactoring much more convenient.

##### Linking

There's only so far you can go with linking in a paper note system for it to remain practical, by contrast there aren't really any limits for digital.

...

I'm going to stop here.

While the idea of writing is "romantic" and may give you some satisfaction because of its tactile elements. When it comes to the practical elements of taking / keeping notes and developing your own knowledge base / second brain, provided some prerequisites are met, digital is unquestionably better.
