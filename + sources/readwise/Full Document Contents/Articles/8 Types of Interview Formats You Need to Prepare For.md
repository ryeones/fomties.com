to give you that insight the job postings dossier team put together a list of eight most common interview formats and what they're all about the first three you're probably already familiar with for example the first one is the traditional interview in this interview format you're sitting across from an interviewer answering standard job interview questions the next format is the Skype or video interview these are used more when applicants are interviewing for roles outside of their home city province or country similar to the Skype interview 

though is the phone interview these are usually used for a first round pre-interview to screen out unqualified applicants next up is the group interview these are more common in retail holiday recruitment and sales roles and internships in this interview format of recruiters looking for people who stand out so be sure to speak up regularly and confidently the fifth format to cover is the working interview here the interviewer wants to actually see you do specific parts of the job before they hire you this is usually 

more common for jobs that have a high level of skill like writing or software coding and if you know your stuff this kind of interview can be way easier than most similar to the working interview the next format is the case or puzzle interview here the interviewer will give you a case study or ask you a puzzle question to solve these types of interviews are more common for consulting and tech sector jobs and interviewers use them to get a sense of the thought process you use to work through a problem next is the firing squad these are more 

common in competitive financial job interviews but for the most part this interview will involve you meeting with three to six different interviewers individually in one seating the questions will be intense but it will also save you from doing too many rounds of interviews finally the last interview format we want to mention is the lunch interview basically if the recruiter wants to interview you over a meal that's a very good sign so don't eat like a slob show the interviewer you're a stand-up person and remind them of
