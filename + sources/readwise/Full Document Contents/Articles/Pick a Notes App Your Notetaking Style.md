around that product to see if it aligns with your style and finally you want to pick a note-taking tool that has the set of features that best enables you to do the work that you actually want to do that matters most to you if you can get these three factors right you'll be well on your way to building your second brain a personalized system to organize your digital life and unlock your creative potential let's get started [Applause] this video is the first in a series 

where i'll walk you through how to pick the best digital notes app for you one that you'll actually want to come back to again and again in upcoming videos we'll break down the most useful effective notes apps currently on the market i'll look at their features and their use cases and i'll even show you the most popular apps being used by thousands of second brand students but in today's video i want to start with you your personality your temperament your note-taking style one of the most useful models i've found that instantly 

resonates with many who are trying to choose their notes app was introduced to me by my friend and fellow creator anne lor lecomphe who is the founder of nest labs and lore noticed that there are three archetypes that many modern note-taking apps and modern note-takers fall into these archetypes are the architect the gardener and the librarian first we have the architect many notetakers long for structure a clear system to organize every facet of their 

life they're looking for a level of customization that blends practicality function and aesthetics if you're an architect you might find yourself trying to create the ultimate edifice to organize your information the architect approaches everything about their note-taking with a systems mindset of architecting their knowledge next is the gardener if your primary feeling when it comes to note-taking is one of wandering dreaming imagining and making 

spontaneous creative leaps you're probably a gardener you want to cultivate new ideas cross-pollinate concepts and sprout lots of creative possibilities you're looking to up end your existing concepts maybe create something new and you're probably not necessarily trying to create a system that knows where it's headed the gardener approaches everything about note-taking with a nurturing exploratory approach of reimagining the relationship to information and making novel connections the third approach to notes 

is that of the librarian the librarian has a deep desire to find the most useful or interesting things that exist in the world and then to capture them to be able to retrieve and study them as needed if you're always collecting new bits of information categorizing your learnings retrieving your insights combining old and new information into a new understanding and especially sharing your favorite learnings with others you are likely a librarian librarians often have a project orientation like 

architects but instead of architecting their entire life their research supports specific projects and learning obsessions the librarian approaches everything about note-taking with a fundamentally practical relationship to information by the way if i sound like i'm a bit too much of a fan of librarians it's because that's the archetype that i most closely associate with i love collecting tidbits of insight and to me the purpose of information is to support my projects and my life areas take a look at these archetypes again do any immediately 

resonate with you i found that it's often as simple as the feeling you get when you hear the words architect gardener librarian see note-taking is a highly personal process and for that reason it's based on intuition and feeling much more than people realize it's about what resonates and connects with you once you identify with one of these archetypes you can start to investigate the apps most associated with each for the architect notion is a popular app it allows you to create 

personal dashboards just in time indexes of notes and information that can be tagged and categorized and sorted and updated dynamically as that information changes for the gardener two of the most recognized apps today are rome research and obsidian these apps are very different in how they organize knowledge but they're both fundamentally about creating new connections between disparate pieces of knowledge a map of content that organically grows as you do and surprises you even with new insights 

you didn't plan for yourself and finally for librarians the most recognized and my personal daily driver is evernote evernote kicked off the modern note-taking phenomenon and has specialized over the years to be the best in class at collecting information from any number of different sources it's quick it's accessible across all your devices and it's just a highly dependable platform for modern knowledge work these are four of the most recognized note-taking apps these four 

apps alone represent 75 of all of our students so you already know each one of them has a very strong community of users ready to support a new notetaker like you finally i've discovered that there is actually a fourth archetype that doesn't quite fit the mold that we've described this kind of note-taker doesn't have a strong bent towards any of these three archetypes they either resonate with several of them or none of them or all of them or more likely they just find the whole 

decision really confusing and kind of unnecessary if that's you i have some good news you have your own archetype you are a student we were likely all students at one point and as students you tend to just naturally have a shorter term orientation such as for a test or an essay or a class students prize ease of use and note-taking they need something quick something easy something accessible they need to be able to manage many different aspects of life but not necessarily go too deep into any one of them in fact going too 

deep can be a liability you already have enough on your plate and you have a specific purpose in mind for taking notes as a student your notes are likely a mix of documentation practical notes to do's and even word for word transcripts but the student archetype is actually the most common type of notetaker it's what we default to when we don't have extra time with that in mind there's a specific set of apps that work great for students apple notes google keep notability and simplenote 

are a few that i enjoy that work well these apps are simpler they're more paired down in their features than the apps we've discussed already they're kind of unopinionated just a few key features that allow practical quick flexible note-taking if you already know which archetype you identify with architect gardener librarian or student leave a comment below and share with us subscribe to this channel to get access to the next videos in this series we'll dig into how many people are using each 

of the most popular notes apps we'll look at which ones are growing the fastest and then we'll look at what are the most important features that distinguish one notes app from the next thanks for watching and i hope you'll join us on your own journey of building a second [Music]
