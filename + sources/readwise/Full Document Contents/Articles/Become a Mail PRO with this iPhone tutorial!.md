## Full Document
The Mail app on your iPhone is probably one of the 
less exciting apps you’ve got installed, but it’s   actually very good, and much improved with some 
additions that came along in iOS16. I’ve never   actually made a complete tutorial video for Mail 
for iPhone, so today I thought I’d change that.   Stick with me, as I walk you step by step, in how 
to use and get the most out of Mail for iPhone.   Just so you know, I’m running 
iOS16.2 as I make this video,   do ensure that you’re running that version or 
newer, so you can do everything we discuss here. OK, let’s get into it. 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*Adding 
Accounts\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* The first thing we need to do to 
make the most of the Mail app,   is add some Mail accounts to it, because 
without that, our app won’t know where to   download email from. We do this by going 
to Settings, then scrolling down to Mail,   and then tapping into Accounts. If you’ve got any 
email accounts already associated with your phone,   they’ll show here. This would most likely be if 
you’ve setup an iCloud account when setting up   your iPhone for example, and it comes with 
an email address, that email address would   most likely be here already, like I’ve got 
here. But we can add some other accounts too. 

To do that, tap on Add Account. Apple 
provide templates for setting up the   most common email addresses, iCloud, Microsoft 
Exchange, GMail, Yahoo, AOL and Outlook.com,   but you can add pretty much any email address 
you like using the Other option at the bottom.   Note that for all of these, you’ll need to 
follow the on-screen instructions and input   the correct information for your account, 
and if you struggle, or you’re unsure about   any of the information you need to input, 
you’ll need to contact your email provider. To show you how easy this is, what I 
will do is just quickly add a GMail   

account. You can see that it’s 
just a case of tapping through,   adding whatever information the app 
asks us to add to verify the account. Also, if I jump back a couple of screens to the 
Accounts page, notice this section here that says   Fetch New Data. If I tap into that, you can see 
that we’ve got some options here, and this page   can be a little confusing if you’re unfamiliar 
with how Push and Fetch works. Essentially,   this is all linked to how frequently mail is going 
to be sent from the mail server to your phone. 

Where possible, I’d recommend enabling Push. I say 
‘where possible’, because it won’t be supported   by all email providers, but most modern ones do 
offer it these days. Push vs Fetch essentially   means how your device learns about and downloads 
new emails. With Push, your device gets notified   about a new email by the email server, and 
then downloads it. When it’s working properly,   email is received almost immediately by your 
phone, and it’s very efficient. Fetch involves   your phone asking the server if there’s new 
email, at a timeframe determined by you. 

\*\*Morning Brew Integration\*\* Before we continue, I want to say thank you 
to the sponsor of today’s video, Morning Brew.  My morning routine used to typically revolve 
around surfing social media and the major   news sites to find out what was going on in 
the world - in other words, a pretty endless   loop of negativity and doom-scrolling.
These days, I prefer to make myself an   espresso and check out the latest edition of 
Morning Brew, an easy 5-minute read that gets   me up to speed with the important news of 
the day. Their reporting style is relaxed,   witty and informative, even when the subject 
matter is a bit dry, with a focus on tech,   

finance and business world essentials.
Like their recent coverage of the world’s   biggest tech show, CES, where there was some 
pretty interesting tech on display. Like this   smart pillow that can detect snoring and 
inflate specific parts of the pillow to   readjust your annoyingly snoring bedmate’s 
head into a position where they no longer   snore. If you sleep next to, or even close to a 
snorer, this tech could be pretty life-changing.  Or how about the coverage of Public Domain Day, 
which happens on January 1st? This year’s Public   

Domain day is already being overshadowed by talk 
of next year’s, when Mickey Mouse - yes the OG   animated mouse himself, becomes copyright-free 
in his original black and white form in 2024.  Why not subscribe to Morning Brew using 
the link in the description - It’s free,   and takes about 15 seconds to do. Thanks again 
to Morning Brew for sponsoring this video. \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*Navigation\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* So, when you open up Mail, this is how your 
screen will most likely look. It’s pretty basic,   but everything that you need 
to get started is either here,   or can be here with a simple edit of this screen. 

The top part of this screen, where it says 
Mailboxes, is kind of an amalgamated view   of all of your mailboxes, pulled together 
into one. We’ve currently got two inboxes,   an iCloud and a GMail account, so the All Inboxes 
will bring all mail from both of them together.   Underneath that, we can see the mailboxes that 
we’ve currently got configured to this device,   which is our iCloud account and GMail account, 
we’ll ignore that for now. If I tap this Edit   button up at the top right, notice that a load 
of options appear. These are essentially filters,   

Apple calls them Smart Mailboxes, and help to 
manage a busy mailbox or collection of mailboxes. So here for example, if I tap on the filter 
that says Attachments, that will then add   an attachments only mailbox to my Mail app. And 
then, when I tap into that mailbox, it will only   show me emails that have been received in any 
of my mailboxes, that contain attachments. If I   jump back to the Edit screen, you can see that 
there are some really useful options in here,   like Flagged Emails, or emails received today. 
One that I would definitely recommend that you   

consider including and then using, is 
the VIP option. If I tap on an email,   and then tap on the contact up at the top, I 
can then choose Add to VIP. With this done,   this contact’s emails will not only be visible in 
the VIP smart mailbox, but they will also create a   notification on my phone. I use this for business 
related contacts where I know that, if they email   me, I want to know about it right away, and 
I can then action their email really quickly. \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*Creating a 
new email\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* So, to draft a new email, tap this button 
in the bottom right of the screen. You can   

see that a new message is created. In the To 
field, you would type in the email address,   or addresses of recipients, or if you’ve 
got a Contact stored in your phone with   an email address associated with them, you 
could simply type in the recipient’s name. If I tap into the Cc/Bcc and From field, we’ve got 
some more options. Cc is Carbon Copy, and Bcc is   Blind Carbon Copy. Essentially, any emails that 
you insert into the Cc field will also receive   the email alongside anyone in the To field, but 
they’ll be able to see that they’ve been Cc’d into   

the email, and will also be able to see the other 
email addresses included in that field. Anyone who   you insert into Bcc will also receive the email, 
but they won’t be able to see any other email   addresses. This is useful if you need to fire the 
same email out to lots of people, but allowing   everyone to see everyone else’s email address 
would perhaps be a breach of data regulations. . In the From field, you can change the email 
address that you’re using to send the email,   if you’ve got multiple accounts setup of course. 

Then in Subject, you’d type in a subject, and 
notice this little bell icon to the right.   You can receive notifications whenever anyone 
replies to the email thread if you wish, so if   it’s a particularly important email that you’re 
keeping track of, this could be quite useful. If we then tap into the body of the email, this 
is of course where we can begin to draft the   email itself. One thing to mention is this line 
here that says “Sent from my iPhone”. You’ve no   doubt seen this loads of times over the years, 
it’s a signature that Apple inserts by default,   

but most people either get rid of it or change 
it. To do that, head into Settings and then Mail,   and then scroll down to the ‘Composing’ 
section. Tap into where it says ‘signature’,   and you can either delete the signature, 
or you can input your own in here instead,   whatever you’d prefer. You can also set this on 
a per account basis, or to cover all accounts. Right, back on the email, 
I’m going to input some text. Notice this bar that appears just above 
the keyboard. We’ve got a number of   options to choose from here, to format the 
email, and add additional content to it. 

If I tap on the Aa button, we’ve got our text 
formatting options. This is pretty extensive,   we can make text bold, italic, underlined or 
struck through. We can make text smaller and   larger using these buttons here, and we can change 
the colour of the text. We can change the default   font if we wish, and then below that, we’ve got 
options for bullets, number bullets, alignment   and indentation of text, so most of your text 
formatting needs should be taken care of here. I’ll tap the cross to come back, 
but notice that when I do that,   

predictive text is trying to predict words 
I might want to input into my email. I’d   like to get back to the previous menu, so to do 
that, I’m going to tap this arrow button here. The photos button will allow me to 
insert an image or a video. I can   choose from my recent photos, or I can 
choose All Photos, to access my entire   photo library. Simply tap on whatever you’d 
like to add, to insert it into the email. The camera icon will access the camera,   and allow me to insert a photo 
or a video right into the email. 

This document with a square around it is the scan 
button. I can use this to scan a paper document   in, replacing the need for a conventional image 
scanner. I find that the best way to do this,   is to position the document on a contrasting 
colour. So a white piece of paper would work best   when positioned on a dark table for example. 
Simply line it up, and scan the image in. This icon of text with a square around 
it is the Live Text option. With this,   rather than scanning a document in, we can 
insert text from anywhere that you capture it,   

into the email as computer text. I’ll 
demo this now to show you how it works. This paper icon here is to insert a file, and 
when we tap on that, we’re taken to our Files app,   and can search for a file, or browse for 
one. Simply tap to insert it into your email. Finally, this pen icon allows us to 
insert a drawing. When we tap on it,   we’re taken to a scribble sheet, with all of the 
usual pen and pencil options down at the bottom,   which we can use to draw something in with our 
finger, and then insert as a PNG file at the end. 

That’s essentially how you draft emails in 
Mail, but before we wrap that section up,   a couple more things to show you. First, like 
everywhere else on the iPhone that involves text,   you can dictate content in if you wish. Tap 
this little microphone button down at the   bottom of the screen, and just begin saying 
what you’d like Siri to input for you. It’s   generally pretty good, and you shouldn’t 
have to manually insert punctuation , but   every now and then you might have to pause 
for a moment to insert a comma or a period. The other thing to show you, is that you can 
drag things from other parts of your iPhone,   

right into Mail if you wish. So here 
for example, I’m in the Photos app,   not in Mail. Let’s say that I want to input 
this photo into my email. Rather than adding   it in from the Mail app, I can just drag it from 
here, into the Mail app, and drop it right onto   the email. You’ll most likely need to use 
two hands to do this, as you can see here. Also, let’s just talk quickly about saving an 
email as a draft. If I tap Cancel, without sending   the email, I have the option to either delete the 
email, or save it as a draft. If I choose Save   

Draft, the email disappears, and if I tap Edit on 
the Mailbox page, you’ll notice that I don’t have   an option to add in a Drafts folder. This doesn’t 
matter though, as the way to access Drafts is to   simply tap and hold for a second on the New Email 
button, and you’ll be taken to your Drafts folder.   We can then access the draft we were working 
on, and pick up where we left off if we wish. \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*PDF 
Shoutout\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* By the way, if you prefer to have 
content like this in a written format,   there’s a PDF to accompany this video, and you 
can access it by becoming a channel member,   

where for a small monthly fee, you’ll get access 
to all video PDFs moving forward, plus the growing   library of old ones. Just hit the Join button 
on this video, and follow the instructions. \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*Sending 
Mail\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* When you’re ready to send an email, you’ll have 
the option do this by pressing this blue button   with the arrow in the upper right corner. If you 
tap here, your email will be sent. But, if you tap   and hold here for a moment, you can choose to send 
the email later. The app will give you contextual   options based on the time of day you do this, 
but you can always press the Send Later button,   

and choose a specific date and time to send it. 
This is a great feature, but do be aware that   you’ll need your phone to be online at the time 
of sending for this to work. So if for example,   you were about to board a 10 hour flight where 
your phone would be offline for the entire time,   and you chose for something to send 
in 2 hours time, this wouldn’t work. Also, as this is an email with an 
image, notice that when I hit send,   I have some image sizing options to choose 
from. Mail can automatically resize the images   to make them small, medium, large or leave 
them as their actual size, which is useful   

if you know that you’re sending to an inbox 
where someone would prefer a smaller message. Also, notice what happens when I hit send. 
We get this ‘Undo Send’ button appear at the   bottom of the screen. If I tap that, 
we’re returned to the draft email,   and the email isn’t sent. Apple have talked 
about this as though it’s an email recall,   and it’s not really. It’s a send 
delay. Essentially, once you hit send,   you’ve got a pre-defined period of 
time to quickly change your mind,   if you notice that you’ve sent something that 
you shouldn’t have. The default is 10 seconds,   

but if we head into Settings, then Mail and scroll 
right the way down to the bottom, we can tap into   Undo Send Delay. We can either toggle this off, or 
choose from 10 seconds, 20 seconds or 30 seconds. \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*Proper 
Weekly\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* By the way, if you’re enjoying the content here, 
why not consider signing up to my newsletter,   the proper weekly. I include some tech news from 
the week, a behind the scenes of what’s happening   here on the channel, as well as a tip for an item 
in the Apple ecosystem. The newsletter goes out   each Friday, it’s free to join, and I’ll include 
a signup link in the description of this video. 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*Receiving 
and Managing   Mail\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* Right, so we now know how to create an 
email, which is a pretty important part   of working with email, let’s explore the other 
part, which is receiving and managing emails. So for that, I’ve sent through a number of emails 
to this account. I’ve sent some personal emails,   and I’ve signed the account up 
to some mailing lists as well,   to give you an idea of how this all looks. First up, a handy little icon to 
know is this one down here in the   bottom left. This is to toggle 
an Unread filter. Toggle it on,   and you’ll only see your unread emails, 
toggle it off, and you’ll see everything. 

If you tap and hold on an email for a moment, you 
can see that we’ve got a number of options. We can   reply, reply to all and forward the email on. We 
can mark the email, either flagging it, marking it   as unread, or moving it to our junk folder. We’ve 
got the notify option here as well, or we can mute   replies to this email. We can move the message to 
a specific folder, delete it, or block the sender. There are also some options that you can 
access by swiping on an email here in the   

inbox. If you swipe left to right, we can mark 
the email as unread, or we can be reminded   about the email. This is handy if you receive 
something that you know you want to work on,   but perhaps not right away, as choosing Remind 
Me will give you some different options for when   to be reminded. At the correct time, the email 
will appear at the top of your mailbox again. If we swipe from right to left, we can 
flag the email or delete it. The More   option is essentially the same as 
pressing and holding on the email,   it’s just that the options 
look slightly different here. 

Tapping into an email, there 
are some options there as well. Notice that up here at the top of the email, we 
can see some limited information, the sender,   our email address and the date that the email was 
received. If I tap into this area, this expands,   and gives me more information. I 
can tap on the sender for example,   to see the actual email address that was used 
to send this email. This is really useful,   especially if you want to check the validity 
of an email that’s been sent to you. Likewise,   increasingly you can see whether an address 
has been digitally certified or not, helping to   

give you the confidence of knowing that an email 
you’ve received has come from a trusted sender. Down at the bottom of the email, we’ve 
got a delete button, a move button where   we can stash this email away in a folder, 
a reply button, and when you tap on that   you’ll have the options for using Reply 
All or Forward, and a New Email button. \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*Mail 
Search\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* Searching for email is really easy in the Mail 
app, there’s not a huge amount to talk about here,   but in order to search, you’re either going to tap 
into the All Inboxes mailbox up here at the top,   or a specific inbox if you’d like to focus 
the search on one inbox in particular. Swipe   

down to show the search bar up here at 
the top, and in there you would search,   either for a term in an email, or in a 
subject line, or the name of a sender,   there’s lots of things you can search for, 
and you can see that as I input a search term,   my app gives me suggestions for 
how and where I might search. \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*Mail 
Settings\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* So that’s essentially everything that you need to 
know about the Mail app. But before we finish the   video, I want to revisit the Mail Settings page, 
to ensure that we’ve covered all of the useful   stuff in there. As a reminder, we open Settings, 
then scroll down to Mail. In here, we can choose   

how much of a preview we’d like to see of each 
email, and whether we’d like to see the To and   Cc labels on the preview or not, as well as 
the ability to edit some of the swipe options. Another useful section is the Threading section 
further down. With Organise by Thread toggled on,   messages that are part of a thread will be 
grouped together, rather than showing you lots of   individual messages. I’ll show you an example on 
the screen now. When you tap on the arrow, you can   

expand the messages out to then locate specific 
emails from within the thread if you need to. Blocked Sender options is useful, as I believe 
the default action here is for emails from blocked   senders to still show in your inbox, but to be 
marked as coming from a blocked sender. Obviously,   the preference here is going to be for the 
email to not make it to your inbox at all,   and to instead get automatically moved to 
the bin, and you can choose that if you wish. Under Composing, you can choose to always 
Bcc yourself into emails if you wish,   and you can also choose 
the default account to use,   

which is handy if you’ve got a main 
account that you use most of the time. \*\*\*\*\*\*End\*\*\*\*\*\* So there you go, that’s the Mail app for 
iPhone, a complete tutorial. What do you think,   do you like the Mail app these days? Or, do you 
insist on using an alternative Mail app? If yes,   which one and why? Drop me 
a comment and let me know. And as ever, if you found this video useful, 
do please consider leaving me a like,   and subscribing to my channel for 
more content like this in the future. See you on the next video.
