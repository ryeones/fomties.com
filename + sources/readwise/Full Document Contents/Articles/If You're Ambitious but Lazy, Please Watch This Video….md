## Full Document
if you're watching this video you're probably someone with extremely extremely ambitious goals which I applaud you for but there's something really problematic stopping you you so desperately want to reach those goals but there's something holding you back procrastination rainfor something keeping you from them you want to know the one shed reason the one thing that stops 99% of people fear not just fear of judgment if 

you're intelligent enough to watch something like this you probably don't care too much about what other people think of you it's fear of ourselves fear that we won't make it that we're not this image of ourselves that we created we can always spend our days idealizing oh my God it will be awesome living this dream life getting this dream goal getting everything we wanted but then we go back to reality and we're not there yet and there's still a,1 different obstacles standing in our way you want to know something the hard part isn't really starting is to keep the momentum 

going for the first few months after you start you have to confront this situation without quitting damn it's hard work damn there's no guaranteed paycheck that I'll get no assurance that this is going to make me succeed barely any support from those you care about and then you make excuses for yourself oh I'm not loved enough it hurts a damn well hurts I know I have like a baby face but I would know that it damn well hurts but you want to know what hurts even more you staying in the exact same 

spot where you are right now you think the cost of winning is high wait till you see the bill regret will send your way literally all that I can tell you is that you have the power to create change for yourself for example 3 months ago I was at just over 2K subs and now I'm over 20k Subs without spamming brain Rod shots you have the power to change and nobody on the internet can do it for you you can watch another video and another video and learn something new but at the end of the day you have to take action 

act upon the knowledge that you have gained the power you so desperately seek is found in the work you are avoiding the most all right that thing you always dreamed of doing it's about time you shut the [ \_\_ ] up and go and do that all right take that step forward because there's no secret pill that you can take the 10x your progress the real 10x pill is in the mistakes you make and learn from along the way I know you have that deep pain inside of you make it worth something
