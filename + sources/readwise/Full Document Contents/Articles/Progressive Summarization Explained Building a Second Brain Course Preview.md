- Category: #Source/videos
- Summary: Progressive summarization is a technique that enhances note-taking by using multiple layers of highlighting to identify key points. First, you capture important excerpts, then you bold the main ideas, and finally, you highlight the most critical parts for quick reference. This method helps you quickly grasp essential information and find relevant notes efficiently in the future.

## Full Document
[Music] to enhance the discoverability of your notes we can turn to a simple habit you probably remember from school highlighting the most important points highlighting is an activity that everyone understands takes hardly any additional effort and works in any app you might use but instead of only one round of highlighting I'll teach you a method of layering several on top of one another I call this technique Progressive summarization and it takes 

advantage of the power of digital notes to make highlights far more useful than anything you did in school the technique is simple save excerpts with the most resonant parts of whatever you're reading or listening to the parts that are most interesting useful personal or surprising then within the excerpts you've captured you will bold the main points as a final step if you come back again to this note you do this one more time and highlight the most important part of the bolded sections Again by the 

end of this process you have three layers of highlighting allowing your eye to jump straight to the most important parts anytime you visit this node in the future so what exactly does this accomplish let's look at an example here's an article in Psychology today instead of capturing the whole text I do my first layer of summarization I capture just the most important quotes by limiting what I keep to the best most important most relevant Parts I'm making all the next steps of distilling much 

easier and if I ever need to know the full details I can always include a link to the original article right there at the bottom but this is still a lot of information to further enhance this node's discoverability I need to add a second layer of distillation I usually do this when I have free time during breaks or on evenings or weekends when I come across the note while working on other projects or when I don't have the energy for more focused work so here's Layer Two Bolding the main points within the note looking over the bolded parts of the same note here here you can see 

how much easier it is to quickly grasp the gist of this note already imagine the difference between reading the original article which might take five to ten minutes of focused attention versus glancing over these bolded points which would take less than a minute layer 3 of progressive summarization is only for notes that are especially long interesting or valuable you can see I now used the highlighting feature offered by many notes apps which paints passages in bright yellow if your notes app doesn't have a highlighting feature 

you can use underlining or another kind of formatting instead the combined bolded and highlighted sections should be just one or two sentences each but these passages capture the message of the original Source beautifully now when I come across this node in the future I'll be able to decide in the blink of an eye whether this source is relevant to my needs if it is I'll have all the additional details and context I need to remember it right in front of me as well as the link to the original article to check the source remember speed is 

everything when it comes to discovering your past notes you have a limited amount of time and energy and the faster you can move through your notes the more diverse and interesting ideas you can collect and connect together [Music] foreign foreign
