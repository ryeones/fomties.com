## Full Document
This book, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant, isone of the best books I have ever readabout financial freedom. In thisepisode of Book Club, which is theongoing series where for the last fiveyears I’ve been distilling anddiscussing highlights and summaries fromsome of my favorite books, we are goingto be talking about the five keycomponents of the financial freedomequation. All right, so the first key ideafrom the book is to find and buildspecific knowledge. Now, this is probablythe thing that is most confusing aboutthe stuff that Naval writes; in that, like,what is specific knowledge? Well, here iswhat he says in the book about whatspecific knowledge is. He writes, "Specificknowledge is knowledge you cannot betrained for. If society can train you, itcan train someone else and replace you."Secondly, he says specific knowledge isfound by pursuing your genuine curiosity

and passion rather than whatever is hotright now. Thirdly, building specificknowledge will feel like play to you, butwill look like work to others. Fourth,when specific knowledge is taught, it’sthrough apprenticeships, not schools. Andfive, specific knowledge is often highlyTechnical or creative, it cannot beoutsourced or automated. The way thatI understand the concept of specificknowledge is that it's this combinationof knowledge and skills that is somewhatunique to you. So, Nal writes that when Italk about specific knowledge, I meanfiguring out what you were doing as a kidor teenager almost effortlessly—something you didn't even consider askill, but people around you noticed. Yourmother or your best friend growing upwould know. An example that Nal uses ismaybe you had an obsessive personality.

You dove into things and remembered themquickly. Or maybe you have a love forscience fiction. You were into readingsci-fi, which means you absorbed a lot ofknowledge very quickly. Maybe you play alot of games, so you understand gametheory pretty well. If I use myselfas an example, there were broadly threethings that I was super intowhen I was a kid and a teenager. Thefirst one was reading a lot of books. Thesecond one was trying to build stuff, sothis was like Legos and airplanemodels when I was a kid. Then, likewebsites and web development—trying totinker away and build.

Things, and the third thing is that Ialways really liked teaching. Iwould always be teaching students whowere younger than me or students in theclass who would ask me for help andstuff like that. Teaching issomething that came very naturally to me,and I found myself effortlessly drawn toit. Now, I would probably call thisa combination of factors — some kind ofspecific knowledge, and in theintersection of these things, likereading a lot of books, enjoyingteaching, and enjoying building stuff,that sort of morphed into this careerthat I've stumbled into, where I makevideos, I write books, and I doreviews of books and stuff like that.

But I didn't get here by setting out 20years ago to become a YouTuber doingproductivity stuff and writing self-helpbooks. It was more a case of pursuingwhat I was genuinely interested in andcurious about, rather than trying tofind the most efficient way to learn askill that can make money or whateverthat might be. Knowledge is found much more by pursuingyour innate talents, your genuinecuriosity, and your passion. It's not byGoing to school for whatever is thehottest job, it’s not by going intowhatever field investors say is thehottest. All right, so one of the thingswe're going to talk about later in thisvideo is the concept of leverage and theconcept of media-based leverage. Thatis where the sponsor of this video comesin, which is Riverside. Riverside is yourall-in-one online studio for video andpodcasting, both recording and editing.

It makes it incredibly easy tocreate high-quality content right fromyour browser. I absolutely love Riverside;I’ve been using it for years to recordpodcasts and remote interviews supereasily. It’s super easy to use and itintegrates really nicely into a workflowfor video and podcast production. Thegreat thing about Riverside is that it’sbuilt specifically for creators like us.

Not only does it let me record in up to4K, but the editing features are reallygood and save a ton of time as well. Forexample, with multitrack editing, we canadjust individual tracks, mute certainparts, or even add scenes automatically.

When I do podcasts with me andmy brother, we don’t want to deal withAll the hassle of having to manually editthings, and so you just click a buttonand the AI automatically removessilencers and switches camera angles,everything, and it's just absolutelyincredible. Oh, and the AI producer alsoadds perfectly animated captions to yourvideos, which is fantastic, especially ifyou're doing short-form content that has thecaptions baked in.

I absolutely loveRiverside; I've been using it for years, and Iwill continue to use it for years. Thankyou so much, Riverside, for sponsoringthis video. So if you're at thispoint in the video, the question youcould be asking yourself is, "What couldMy own specific knowledge is important, and there area few different ways of thinking aboutthis. Firstly, you can think aboutinternal versus external motivation. Youwant to ask yourself, what are the sortsof things I am internally, intrinsicallymotivated to learn more about? This could, for example, be thedifference between someone who, when theywere a kid or a teenager, would takeapart computers for fun versus someonewho learns to code because they’ve heard

that tech pays really well. So whenyou’re internally motivated to do stuff,then it’s probably stuff that you wouldbe reading about in your spare time, ormaybe talking about that thing withfriends. You might even talk about it a bit too much;it’s probably the thing that you wouldfind yourself drawn to, even if youweren’t getting paid for it. Now, if youcompare this to external motivation,that’s when you’re following markettrends, like, “Hey, I hear AI agents arereally hot right now, so let me build aninterest in AI agents.” You’ll have asense of constantly checking whether thething is profitable. This is like thedifference between someone who starts aYouTube channel because they love theThe idea of personal self-expression versussomeone who starts a YouTube channelbecause they think it'll make them money.

If you're in that category whereyou're only starting a YouTube channelbecause you think it'll make you money,then you're constantly going to bechecking to see, "Have I made money yet?""Have I made money yet? Have I made money? "Yeah, and given that it takes ages tomake money and it's not even guaranteed,chances are if you are chasing startinga YouTube channel or any kind of skill,because you see the money on the otherend of the thing, chances are you won'tstick to it long enough for it toactually work, and you probably won'tenjoy it very much either, which meansyou will be outcompeted if it's a zero-sum gameby people who genuinely doenjoy the thing. Secondly, you can thinkof building specific knowledge in the

sense of process versus outcome. Are youfocused on the process or are youfocused on the outcome? Generally, thevibe is that if you're building specificknowledge, i.e., things that you can't betrained for, things that are found bypursuing your genuine curiosity andpassion, if you're genuinely leaning intoYour own natural inclinations thenchances are you'll get lost in theprocess rather than being fixated on theoutcome. And thirdly, something that Navaloften talks about in interviews is thatif you're looking for specific knowledge,you want to be looking at what are theintersections or the unusual or uniquecombinations that are specific to you.

True valuable specific knowledgeoften comes from combining interests ina way that might seem strange to otherpeople at first. Like if we take someonelike Joe Rogan, for example, he starts offas a comedian and then he gets intofighting, and then he gets into commentatingon martial arts fights and stuff, and thenhe develops a skill to just have a conversationwith anyone. Then he starts a podcast, which endsup becoming one of the biggestpodcasts in the world. But thiscombination of a comedian, fighter, commentator,and interviewer, that's kind of aninteresting combination that not manypeople in the world have. Or if you lookat Naval Ravikant himself, there arethousands and thousands of investors outthere, but Naval is one of the mostWell-known, not because he is aparticularly good investor, but becausehe combines the investingentrepreneurial stuff withphilosophizing on Twitter and writingessays and these tweet storms about

stuff like this — like wealth andhappiness and health, and how toget rich without getting lucky. It'sthis combination of the philosophizingwith the investing thing that leads toan interesting combination that makesNaval much more well-known than mostother investors who maybe specializejust in the investing component. Again,what this is trying to get at is that ifyou really want to become wealthy, if youwant to be financially free, don't justfollow the previously pre-trodden paths,because if there was genuinely a paththat you could literally just, you know,stack the blocks and follow thepath to a tee, then that would getyou rich, and everyone would already be doingthat, and that would be priced into theamount of money you can make from thething. So to round off this section,here are a couple of prompts that canhelp you think about finding your ownspecific knowledge.

Do on weekends what feels like play toyou but looks like work to other people.Secondly, what topics make you lose trackof time when you're learning about them?Thirdly, what unique combinations ofinterests do you have that seemunrelated? And four, what do your friendsconstantly ask your advice about? All ofthese are different ways of getting atwhat your specific knowledge could be — tofind within yourself innately and thenbuild upon that. But having specificknowledge alone isn't enough if you wantto build wealth or if you want to buildfinancial freedom without getting lucky.

There's all sorts of people out there,like researchers, developers, andpeople with deep, deep unique expertise,who haven't achieved financial freedombecause they're missing the othercomponents of this little financialfreedom equation. And that brings us onto component number two, which is[Music].

Accountability. Now, as it relates toaccountability, what Nal says is, "Embraceaccountability and take business risksunder your own name."Society will reward you withresponsibility, equity, and leverage. NalWrites, we are socially hardwired to notfail in public under our own names. Thepeople who have the ability to fail inpublic under their own names actuallygain a lot of power. So this is the firstaspect of accountability that he talksabout, this ability to actually takerisks under your own personal name. Now,in most industries, the people who aremaking the most money are most likelythe people whose names are out there andwhose names themselves are on the line.

If we take the industry of medicine, forexample, you could totally make areasonable living as a doctor where noone really knows who your name is otherthan your employer. And like, you know, youintroduce yourself to your patients, butwithin medicine, the doctors who tend tomake the most money tend to be the oneswho are taking risks under their ownpersonal name. They are building apersonal brand for themselves. They'reputting themselves out there; maybethey're getting really good atorthopedic surgery, and so they're knownas the best orthopedic surgeon inNew York. And so patients are activelyseeking out that individual rather thansaying, "Hey, I’m going to go to thisHospital, 'cause this hospital is reallygood, and I'll just be paired withwhatever surgeon happens to be workingon the day. Again, that's totallyfine. For most doctors, the goal ofbecoming wealthy is not the primary goalthey're working towards, but the doctorswho tend to be the wealthiest, and that'swhat we're talking about here: financialfreedom and how to build wealth. They tend tobe the ones taking risks under their ownpersonal name, building their ownpersonal brand, taking accountabilitywithout hiding behind a brand or an

institution. Why do companies sellthemselves to Berkshire Hathaway? It's notbecause they care intrinsically aboutBerkshire Hathaway; they care about WarrenBuffett because Warren Buffett has builta strong personal brand, professionalreputation, and credibility around his ownname. Therefore, people want to dobusiness with Warren Buffett becausehe's built this credibility for being afair guy, for holding onto stuffforever, for not really interferingwith the business. That's one form ofaccountability in that you are puttingyour name to things, but another form ofaccountability that Nal talks about inThe book is about being accountable for youroutputs rather than your inputs. So whatdoes this mean? Well, for the most part, ifyou are, for example, an employee, you tendto be accountable for your inputs inthat your job is to show up and put inthe hours. Fundamentally, the employer isbuying your time, and the employer ishoping that as a result of that time,certain outputs will get produced, andthose outputs will drive certainoutcomes for the business or for thecustomers, or whatever. But fundamentally,you're accountable for your inputs.

The problem with being accountable for yourinputs is that your time, value, andwork—and how much you get paid—isgenerally quite annoyingly correlated.Then you've got level two, where you'reaccountable for your outputs. Now, in thiscontext, you could imagine someone being,let's say, a freelance writer. Now, ifyou're a freelance writer and you'regetting paid per article you produce,suddenly you're accountable for youroutputs rather than your inputs. Theclient does not really care how long ittakes you to write the article as long asyou produce the article. Therefore,you have decorrelated the amount of time.

You're putting into the thing with theamount of value you're creating and theamount of money you can get paid fordoing the thing. But then you've gotlevel three where you're accountable foroutcomes. Now again, if we use the exampleof a, let's say, a freelance writer beingaccountable for inputs, that might be beingpaid per hour for writing a sales page.Being accountable for outputs might bebeing able to charge, I don't know, $5,000for a draft of a sales page. But beingaccountable for outcomes, that would belevel three of accountability, might besaying to the client, "Hey, don't pay me toactually do the work of creating the

sales page, but anytime this sales pagemakes more money than your previous onedid, I want 20% of the upside. That iswhere you are accountable for theoutcome. Now, as you go up thisaccountability spectrum from input tooutput to outcome, you as an individualend up taking on more and more risk, butthe rewards also get higher and higher.And as you go up this accountabilityspectrum as well, you also end upspending more time sweating at night ifthings are not working out. This is alsowhat Naval means by taking accountability.

In this capitalist world that we live in,the greatest rewards go to the peoplewho take the greatest risks. Now, in aworld where you're being employed by abusiness and being paid an hourly rate,you're unlikely to get very rich off ofthat, even if it's a very high hourlyrate, because the business and, byextension, the business owner are theones taking on the risk of beingaccountable for outputs and for outcomes.

You're simply being paid an hourly wageto hopefully generate some outputs andhopefully generate some outcomes, butyou're not really going to capture thevalue that you've created because you'renot taking on the risk. He does writethat accountability is a double-edgedthing; it allows you to take credit whenthings go well and to bear the brunt ofthe failure when things go badly. Hewrites, in the old days, the captain wasexpected to go down with the ship; if theship was sinking, then literally the lastperson to get off was the captain.Accountability does come with real risks,but we're talking about a businesscontext here. The risk in a businesscontext would be that you'd probably bethe last one to get your capital back.

If you’d be the last one to get paidfor your time, the time that you put in,and the capital you put into the company,these are at risk. But the point that hemakes is that in a modern society, thisdownside risk is actually quite small.Even personal bankruptcy can wipe thedebts clean. In good ecosystems, he writes,I'm most familiar with Silicon Valley,but generally, people will forgivefailures as long as you were honest andmade a high integrity effort. So at thispoint, we have talked about specificknowledge, and we have talked aboutaccountability. But even those thingsaren't enough. For example, you couldimagine a doctor who is employed by thisbig hospital, and that doctor or surgeonis really, really good. They are takingrisks under their own personal name, andthey have deep specific knowledge. Butthey are unlikely to get as rich as theperson who owns the hospital.

That brings us to point number three fromNival's book, and point number three is[Music].Equity, Nival writes, if you don't own apiece of a business, you don't have apath towards financial freedom. Why isowning equity in a business important toBecoming rich, well, it's ownership versuswage work. If you are paid for renting atyour time, even lawyers and doctors, youcan make some money, but you're not goingto make the money that gives youfinancial freedom. You're not going tohave passive income where a business isearning for you while you are onvacation. Without ownership, your inputsare very closely tied to your outputs inalmost any salary job, even one paying alot per hour like lawyer or doctor.

You're still putting in the hours, andevery hour you get paid. Withoutownership, when you're sleeping, you'renot earning. When you're retired, you'renot earning. When you're on vacation,you're not earning, and you can't earnnonlinearly. If you look at even doctors,who get rich, like really rich, it'sbecause they open a business. They open aprivate practice. The private practicebuilds a brand, and the brand attractspeople. Or they build some kind ofmedical device, a procedure, or a processwith intellectual property. Essentially,you're working for somebody else, andthat person is taking on the risk andhas the accountability, the intellectualproperty, and the brand.

To pay you enough, they’re going to payyou the bare minimum they have to to getyou to do their job. That can be a highbare minimum, but it’s still not going tobe true wealth where you’re retired butstill earning. If you look at someonelike a management consultant or someonelike a lawyer or someone like a privateequity partner, the way they get reallyrich is because they own equity in thebusiness. It tends not to be from thesalary that they’re getting paid. And ashe talks about, there’s a couple ofdifferent routes here. So, for example, youcould work at a tech company that givesyou some amount of equity in the company

in return for you working there. You know,there’s a lot of people who join earlystage startups. They’re taking a big riskbecause most startups don’t work, but ifthe startup does work and then sells forI don’t know, tens, hundreds of millionsor billions, or whatever the thing mightbe, then even as an early stage employee,you can get pretty rich in that process.Secondly, there is what MJ DeMarco callsthe slowlane path to wealth, which isbasically where you have a job and youspend less than you earn, and then youput the remainder of that into something.

Like the stock market, and so you couldinvest that in the S&P 500. You couldinvest in the top 500 companies in theUS, you could invest in just tech stocksor whatever. The problem with thatapproach is that if you want to makereal wealth through that, you have to beputting in a ton of money, like millions,into the stock market to get enoughpassive income for it to be, you know,lead to meaningful wealth or meaningfulfinancial freedom. But what MJ DeMarkcalls the fast lane path to wealth is bystarting your own business because youhave 100% or like a massive chunk ofequity in your own business rather than

trying to buy0.00001% of Apple every year based onthe amount of money, spare money, yousaved up from your salary, forexample. But even equity ownership byitself has limits. Like if you imagineyou starting a very small business, likethe local restaurant or something, youare unlikely to get very rich off ofjust starting simply the localrestaurant. And that is where principalnumber four comes in, and that isleverage. Now this whole leverage stuffis something that Nal is very famous for.

He writes that there are three broadclasses of leverage. One form of leverageis labor: other humans working for you. Itis the oldest form of leverage andactually not a great one in the modernworld. I would argue this is the worstform of leverage that you could possiblyuse. Managing other people is incrediblymessy; it requires tremendous leadershipskills. You're one short hop from a mutinyor getting eaten or torn apart by themob. Secondly, money is good as a form ofleverage. It means every time you make adecision, you multiply it with money.Capital is a trickier form of leverageto use; it’s the one thatpeople have used to get fabulouslywealthy in the last century. It’sprobably been the dominant form ofleverage in the last century. But then,the final form of leverage is brand new,the most democratic form. It is productswith no marginal cost of replication.

This includes books, media, movies, andcode. Code is probably the most powerfulform of permissionless leverage. All youneed is a computer; you don’t needanyone’s permission. And this whole ideaof leverage is being able to multiplyyour own efforts. This book, for example,Is a form of leverage. Long ago, I wouldhave had to sit in a lecture hall andlecture each of you personally. I wouldhave maybe reached a few hundred people,and that would have been that. So, booksfor example, are a form of media leverage,where you do the work once, and then youcould sell the thing potentiallyinfinite times. Code software, for example,is a form of leverage where you do thework once to create the product andmaybe a little bit of work inmaintaining it, and then in theory, youcould sell it an infinite number oftimes. Probably the most interestingthing to keep in mind about new forms ofleverage is that they are permissionless.

They don’t require somebody else’spermission for you to use them orsucceed. For labor leverage, someone hasto decide to follow you or be employedby you. For capital leverage, someone hasto give you money to invest or to turninto a product. Coding, writing, books,recording podcasts, tweeting, and YouTubing,these kinds of things are permissionless.You don't need anyone's permission to dothem, and that's why they are veryegalitarian. They’re great equalizers ofleverage.

For example, now has an army of robotsworking for him at nighttime while heor she sleeps after they've written thecode, and it's cranking away. So, if youcombine these things—if you've gotspecific knowledge, i.e., this combinationof unique skills that are somewhatunique to you, that you have personalinterest in, you combine that withaccountability—like taking risks underyour own personal name, putting yourpersonal name to something and beingaccountable for outputs or outcomes, youcombine that with starting a businessaround the thing and having equity inthat particular business. Then you choosea vehicle. So, rather than opening thelocal restaurant that has very littleleverage around it, unless you like hirepeople to work in your restaurant—whichis kind of annoying—you find a way touse media or content and a code inparticular to like do the stuff that youknow as your vehicle for the business.

All of that sets you up very nicely tobecome wealthy, to become financiallyfree. And then we have key principlenumber five, which is time, and there is asubsection in the book entitled "Bepatient." One thing I figured out later inLife is generally, at least in the techbusiness in Silicon Valley, great. Peoplehave great outcomes. You just have to bepatient. Every person I met at thebeginning of my career, 20 years ago,I looked at them and said, "Wow, thatguy or gal is super capable, so smart anddedicated." Almost withoutexception, all of them became extremely successful.

You just had to give them a long enoughtime scale. It never happens in the timescale you want or they want, but it doeshappen. It takes time. Even once you haveall of these pieces in place, there is anindeterminate amount of time you have toput in. If you're counting, you'll run outof patience before success actuallyarrives. Oh, that's good! If you'recounting, you'll run out of patiencebefore success actually arrives. Again,this speaks to this idea aroundfollowing your curiosity. If you're doingsomething that genuinely feels like playto you, you won't be counting the minutesdown, and like the hours down and thedays and the years waiting tobecome successful, waiting to become rich.

You'd be doing the thing anyway, andweirdly, it's the people who are notseeking the money who tend to get theMoney, everybody wants to be richimmediately, but the world is anefficient place. Immediate doesn't work;you do have to put in the time, you dohave to put in the hours. And so, I thinkyou have to put yourself in the positionwith the specific knowledge, with theaccountability, with leverage, and with theauthentic skill set. You have to be thebest in the world at what you do. Oh, thisis good stuff! This is good stuff; youhave to enjoy it and keep doing it. Keepdoing it and keep doing it! Don't keeptrack and don't keep count, because ifyou do, you will run out of time. Man,that's good stuff! Now, you know, I was intwo minds about whether or not tomake this video, because I like to makevideos that are a bit more actionable,that give you more of like a step-by-you;you know, follow the step-by-step process.

Here's how you build a YouTube channelfrom the ground, etc., etc. But this bookdoesn't really give you a step-by-stepprocess. Instead, it gives you more likethe philosophical way of thinking about it.What I was reallyworried about before making this videois that, oh, is there reallyany value in this video? Will people justI think that people feel hesitant, thinking, "Oh, they're not going toread the book because it's not step by step or it's just toohigh level." I thought, you know what? Ihave benefited enormously from this bookby thinking in these different ways; bythinking, "Okay, specific knowledge.

What are the differentfactors that I'm personally interested in? Where can I find theintersection of those?" Accountability.Okay, cool. I need to take risks under myown name. Really, I need to decorrelate my own timefrom the value that I’m trying to add tothe world. I need to own pieces ofbusinesses, preferably my own. Ineed to have leverage. So, media orcontent, which is the thing that I do, andcode, which is the thing that we’re nowdoing with software like VoicePal andProgressPal and Superfocus. Myteam and I are building various different apps;that is a form of code-based leverage.

And then, the time thing is like, "Oh, Ijust need to do this over a long enoughtime horizon." Following this adviceand thinking in these terms for myselfhas had an enormous impact on my ownlife, and I think this is a really goodFramework: if you're genuinelyinterested in becoming financially freeand becoming wealthy, you really can'texpect to get there by watching aYouTube video that gives you astep-by-step roadmap because, like Isaid, if there was a step-by-step roadmap,other people would already befollowing it, and it would be priced intothe system, and it wouldn't work anymore.

But what I really love about this bookis that we’ve barely scratchedthe surface. There’s a load ofinteresting stuff in here abouthappiness and about health, and aboutwhat's even the point of moneyanyway. But like we've literally justfocused on the first, I don’t know, 50, 60,70 pages that specifically talk abouthow to get wealthy. I really wouldrecommend the book; there’s a lot ofreally good wisdom in here.

But I’m hoping that if you’ve gotten to thispoint in the video, you can see that thiswas a little bit of a high-level thing, butI’m hoping you found it useful anyway.And like I said, you should definitelycheck out the book if you are lookingfor more specific advice on how tobecome financially free.

Here is a conversation I had with afriend recently who is a corporatelawyer who wanted to become financiallyfree by making passive income.This is a recounting of the conversationthat we had, which goes into a little bitmore practicalities around how toactually do this stuff. So thank you somuch for watching, and I will see youhopefully in the next video.
