It combines fast capturing of journal entries with fast access to connected knowledge.

#### Purpose

**Forever ✱ Notes** is designed to help you capture thoughts quickly, reflect on them, and organize them meaningfully. It’s about more than just collecting information—it's about slowing down, intentionally linking notes, and building a personalized system over time. This way you avoid a digital graveyard of notes, keeping only what’s truly useful.

#### Grows with you

**Forever ✱ Note**s is a modular system that adapts to your needs through three levels of mastery:

* ‍**Level 1 (Basic)**: Use the ✱ [**Home**](https://www.myforevernotes.com/articles/home/) Note, ✱ [**Tags**](https://www.myforevernotes.com/articles/tags/), and ✱ [**Collections**](https://www.myforevernotes.com/articles/collections/) to keep your notes organized and easy to access.
* ‍**Level 2 (Pro)**: Build on the basics by adding ✱ [**Hubs**](https://www.myforevernotes.com/articles/hubs/) to create central notes that link related content for broader topics.
* **Level 3 (Advanced)**: Incorporate ✱ [**Journal**](https://www.myforevernotes.com/articles/journal/) Notes for deeper reflection, tracking progress, and long-term planning alongside your organized system.

Each level builds upon the previous, allowing you to scale the system as your needs grow.

#### Why Apple Notes

**Apple Notes** is a powerful tool that’s already on your device, completely free and seamlessly integrated across all Apple platforms—iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and even VisionOS. Its tight system integration means you can quickly add or find notes using Lock Screen controls, Spotlight Search, Widgets, or Shortcuts. With shared notes and fast access on any device, it keeps everything organized and available when you need it.

The minimum requirement to use **Forever ✱ Notes** effectively is having Apple Notes with iOS 17 or later installed on your device.

#### What it’s not

**Forever ✱ Notes** is not a direct replacement for tools like Bullet Journal, Obsidian, Notion, or Roam Research. It's made for those who find these platforms too complex for their needs. While it supports basic and intermediate information retrieval, it may lack the advanced features of those apps. It’s also not for task management—use Apple Reminders or other apps for your daily to-do lists.
