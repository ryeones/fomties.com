- Summary: A software developer often gets stuck on problems and finds that explaining them helps him figure out solutions. One day, his friend gives him a rubber duck and suggests he talk to it about his issues. This technique of explaining problems to someone or something without knowledge can lead to insights and solutions, making it a helpful practice in both coding and life.

## Full Document
so I'm a software developer by day and by night and sometimes by weekend but I want to tell you a story about two software developers the first developer was always full of energy he was always writing tons and tons of code but every so often he would get just stumped for some reason the code he wrote was not working the way it was supposed to and he would try everything to fix it he'd write some more tests he'd go line by line through the code trying to figure out where his mistake was made but he couldn't seem to find it so finally in disgust he pushes back from his desk and he walks over to talk to the other developer and he starts to explain his problem he gives his friend the background of what he's trying to do he 

talks about the way that he went about implementing it and in the middle of describing the problem he suddenly pauses never mind he says I I got it and he walks away the next day he's working on an entirely different problem and he's coding away and making lots of progress and gets stumped again and this time he's even more frustrated he tries fixing things and it doesn't go well so he pushes back from his desk again and marches over to his friend and in the middle of explaining the problem boom that flash of insight happens again and he marches back to his desk a little embarrassed now the third day he's 

working on some super important Mission critical thing and gets stuck yet again so he marches over to the developer and the developer stops him before he can get a word out and the other developer says look I am super super super busy with my own stuff but I got you something and he hands him a rubber duck the first guy says okay but dude I got a I got a problem at the mission critical I I need I need your help the second developer says no you really don't just 

explain what you're doing to the duck and so the first developer like a complete idiot begins explaining his software problem to this inanimate rubber duck which causes hrome concerns but that really has nothing to do with the story and surprise surprise in explaining it he figures out what was wrong and the day is saved yeah fairy tales the odd thing is this isn't just some story that's been passed down by neck beards from generation to generation it's actually a legitimate software development practice that if you get stuck on a problem that you know 

very very well try explaining it to someone or something that has no experience with it and more often than not you'll end up accidentally solving your problem because usually problems are not things that are completely over our heads they just happen to exist in areas that we take for granted and so we never really examine those the reason I bring the story up is that it's not just a software development thing it's kind of a life thing if you can find some way to actually deconstruct whatever it is that you may be struggling with you may often find you have the answers to the 

questions that you're asking simply in trying to make the argument in the first place for me A lot of times in making these videos and trying to make an actual point I actually figure out how I managed to get to that point in the first place or occasionally I discover that the point was completely invalid and then I have to restart a video huh nope this one's valid so my advice to you today is that if you have a problem try explaining it from the perspective of someone who doesn't have your background and uh if you don't have a friend friend or a journal or 

somewhere else to express it might want to buy a rubber duck
