## Full Document
Every coat needs better pockets.

There are categories of products or services where there’s a universal area for improvement. When in doubt, make the pockets better.

The interesting work is in realizing that you might offer a product or service where there are non-universal preferences. Areas where improvement isn’t valued.

We might not benefit by always focusing on the pockets.
