- Summary: Designers should consider using Obsidian in their design process, as it greatly aids in research and idea linking. It allows users to create markdown notes that can connect various aspects of their projects, making information easily accessible. The recent Canvas feature enhances this by enabling designers to visually organize notes, images, and videos all in one place.

### Designers —You Should Include Obsidian In Your Design Process

#### The research phase has never been easier

I’ve already written an article about it being 

[my app of 2022](https://archive.ph/o/vca1N/https://medium.com/@MattDoyle/obsidian-is-my-app-of-2022-heres-why-164d2f6ed799). In that article, I mention the versatility that Obsidian provides. I’ve been able to develop this further by starting to include it in my design process.

Now, I’m not a freelance designer, I work in-house so this has only been for my own personal projects.

But I believe that Obsidian works well enough that freelance designers could include it in their process.

#### Obsidian is perfect for research and linking ideas

For most designers, it’s unlikely that they’ll have an in-depth knowledge of every company or individual they’re designing for.

This makes research one of the most important parts of the process.

Whether we are researching the company itself, competition, the industry or anything relating to that industry.

All of this has influence on what we end up designing and also what the client will want when it comes to the work we provide.

This is the first reason that Obsidian should be the first port of call for Designers.

Creating notes for the company which can then link to further notes for the industry and their competition means you can quickly switch between what you need to know and what you can link together.

These notes are also just simple markdown (.md) files, which also means you can move them and not have to worry about being unable to open them at a later date.

Now, while this is good, this next feature is something that I feel is even better.

#### Canvas

Obsidian recently released their new update which included the brand new plug-in named ‘Canvas’.

This is essentially the perfect place for Designers to build their own boards that can include everything about the project they’re working on.

The best part about this is that you can include images and even videos onto this.

So if you’re feeling like you want to try out a new Youtube tutorial and hope it can help with your current brief — include it.

It’s essentially a visual way to link your notes, images and other media together without having to use multiple apps.
