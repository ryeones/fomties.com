## Full Document
Imagine you've just purchased a new home. You're standing in your backyard, planning
out your dream garden… And you spot a corner of the yard that would
be perfect for a big oak tree. So, you plant a sapling, apply a little TLC
over the years, and wait… Hoping that it will eventually blossom into
a mature tree one day. Now, you might not know it, but this is what
a strategy called "growth investing" is all about. Putting time and effort into something in
its early days when there's a lot of uncertainty… 

So that you may receive a major payoff down
the line, if successful. Want to learn more? Then grab a shovel and let's dig in! A growth investor's main goal is to maximize
their investment returns over the long term. They typically look for companies that are
expected to increase their profits at a much faster rate than others in their industry… And see their stock prices rise dramatically
as a result. Just like a sapling growing quickly in its
first few years. Compare that to an income investor, whose
main goal is to maximize the money they receive from their investments today. 

They'd likely favour more established and
predictable businesses that pay a dividend. Like a mature tree that already offers lots
of shade. Or a value investor, whose main goal is to
buy investments they believe to be undervalued to sell at a higher price down the line. They'd look for withering trees that are crying
out for more water and a little pruning. So, now that you understand the aim of growth
investing, you're probably asking yourself: What makes a company a growth stock? Well, a few things. First off, growth stocks tend to be smaller
or younger companies that don't generate much, 

if any, profit or even revenue just yet. They're still refining their product or service
and working to build up their customer base. Larger, more established growth companies
exist too, but the thread is the same: They're focused on launching new products
and rapidly increasing their slice of the market. Second, growth stocks tend to have a lot of
room to expand their business. That could be because they might offer a unique
product that solves a problem nobody else can. 

Think a biotechnology firm that's developed
a new treatment for a rare disease. Or perhaps their service provides a more convenient
solution to a problem faced by a lot of customers. Think a ride-sharing startup that makes getting
around as easy as a few taps on a smartphone app. Or maybe their product drastically reduces
the cost of doing business. Think a robotics manufacturer that cuts vehicle
production time by 30-percent. Whatever it may be, growth companies address
a large market – and may have huge upside as a result. Third, growth stocks typically don't pay dividends. 

Instead, they reinvest most, if not all, of
their eventual profit into expanding their business further. So, investors only make money from their investment
when they sell shares for more than they bought them. Finally, growth stocks tend to be expensive
by many fundamental financial metrics that measure share price relative to earnings,
revenue, or assets. That's because those measures only consider
a company's current finances. However, growth investors care more about
the profit and revenue these businesses are 

expected to generate in the future. Those types of metrics, while important to
consider, won't tell the whole story for growth stocks. With all that said, what type of investor
might lean towards growth investing? Typically, it's individuals who are investing
for the longer term – at least five years. That's because it will likely take several
years for a growth company to realize its potential. Plus, there are likely to be many ups and
downs along the way. Long-term investors can ride out the potentially
large swings in growth stocks because they have more time to make up for any declines. 

Shorter-term investors likely don't have that
luxury. Similarly, investors who want steady income
from their investments above all probably wouldn't gravitate towards growth. So, if you're thinking about growth investing,
make sure it fits your investor profile and time horizon. As you've probably gathered, growth investing
can be summed up as "higher risk, likely higher reward." We'll take a closer look at both sides of
that coin in our lesson, "What are the risks of growth investing?"
