- Summary: This book explores how to design sharing systems in cities by addressing two key questions: how to create these systems and what knowledge is needed for their design. It identifies two main paradigms of sharing: 'design by capital' and 'design by commoning,' and emphasizes the importance of a systems approach in guiding effective sharing practices. The authors argue that by understanding and specifying the components of sharing systems, we can enhance the ideal of sharing and resolve disagreements about it.
