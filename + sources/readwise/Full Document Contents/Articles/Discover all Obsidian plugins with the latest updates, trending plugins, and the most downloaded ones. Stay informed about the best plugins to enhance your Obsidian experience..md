![The Must-Have Obsidian plugins for 2025](https://www.dsebastien.net/content/images/size/w2000/2022/12/obsidian.svg)The logo of Obsidian
In this article, I'll list my favorite plugins for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/?ref=dsebastien.net). Most of those are part of my Obsidian Starter Kit:

[![](https://public-files.gumroad.com/39uqrcaxowvpvf4srzeq97jpcecb)![](https://public-files.gumroad.com/zdjaf5bt0gfgsyljxmc3hoeaxv8l)](https://developassion.gumroad.com/l/obsidian-starter-kit?ref=dsebastien.net)[Gumroad](https://developassion.gumroad.com/l/obsidian-starter-kit?ref=dsebastien.net) 
#### **Introduction**

Obsidian has a really large community and a huge library of community plugins (2000+ at the time I'm updating this).

Those plugins really add a lot of value to Obsidian and make for a much better user experience. Exploring those can be daunting as there are [hundreds](https://obsidian-plugin-stats.vercel.app/plugins?ref=dsebastien.net). Let me spare you some time and introduce you to the very best plugins out there!

A word of warning though: you don't need plugins to get started. Those improve and empower existing workflows, but none are mandatory. If you're just getting started, keep things simple. You can add some plugins over time, but don't waste your time in the beginning, and instead focus on what matters: taking and making notes!

#### How to find Obsidian plugins

First of all, keep in mind that this list is opinionated. There are many many more plugins out there. So let me first tell you where you can find additional ones.

There are various ways to discover valuable Obsidian plugins. First of all, you can use the official community plugins list:

[![](https://www.dsebastien.net/content/images/icon/favicon-2.svg)![](https://www.dsebastien.net/content/images/thumbnail/banner.png)](https://obsidian.md/plugins?ref=dsebastien.net)Official community plugins list 
Second, you can use the Obsidian Plugin Stats website to explore popular plugins, search by tags, etc:

[![](https://www.dsebastien.net/content/images/icon/favicon-1.png)![](https://www.dsebastien.net/content/images/thumbnail/logo-512.png)](https://obsidian-plugin-stats.ganesshkumar.com/?ref=dsebastien.net)Third-party Obsidian Plugin stats 
Third, you can follow Nuno Campos, who regularly reviews the newest plugins:

[![](https://www.dsebastien.net/content/images/icon/10fd5c419ac61637245384e7099e131627900034828f4f386bdaa47a74eae156-1)![](https://www.dsebastien.net/content/images/thumbnail/1-YKILyydUsIAaYPFIDktVew.png)](https://medium.com/@nuno.f.s.campos?ref=dsebastien.net)[Medium](https://medium.com/@nuno.f.s.campos?ref=dsebastien.net) 
Lastly, if you're a geek like me, you can keep an eye on the official plugins list, which is defined in this JSON file:

[![](https://www.dsebastien.net/content/images/icon/pinned-octocat-093da3e6fa40-3.svg)![](https://www.dsebastien.net/content/images/thumbnail/obsidian-releases)](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases/blob/master/community-plugins.json?ref=dsebastien.net)[GitHub](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases/blob/master/community-plugins.json?ref=dsebastien.net) 
And if you're a nerd like me, you could even leverage AI and programming to analyze the raw plugin stats to discover popular/trending plugins:

[![](https://www.dsebastien.net/content/images/icon/pinned-octocat-093da3e6fa40-4.svg)![](https://www.dsebastien.net/content/images/thumbnail/obsidian-releases-1)](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases/blob/master/community-plugin-stats.json?ref=dsebastien.net)[GitHub](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases/blob/master/community-plugin-stats.json?ref=dsebastien.net)

#### **Built-in Obsidian plugins**

Obsidian comes out of the box with a set of "core" plugins that are disabled by default. You can enable/disable those through the options, under "Core plugins". Many of those are super useful.

Here's a short overview:

* Audio recorder: easily record audio from Obsidian and add the recording as attachment
* Backlinks: show links from other notes to the current one
* Command palette: hit "Cmd/Ctrl + P" to show the palette and quickly execute commands
* Daily notes: create or open today's daily note. I don't recommend this plugin because the "Periodic Notes" plugin discussed later in this article is much more powerful
* File explorer: see the files and folders in the vault
* File recovery: recover files
* Format converter: convert Markdown from other applications to Obsidian's own format
* Graph view: View a graph that displays links between notes
* Notes composer: manipulate notes (merge, split, refactor)
* Outgoing links: show links from the current note to other ones. Also detects unlinked mentions
* Outline: display the outline of the current note
* Page preview: preview the content of links by pressing Ctrl/Cmd while hovering those
* Publish: publish notes through Obsidian Publish
* Quick switcher: Use "Ctrl/Cmd + O" to navigate between notes
* Random note
* Search
* Slash commands: Allows triggering commands by typing "/" in the editor
* Starred: star frequently used files and searches
* Sync: synchronize files across devices using Obsidian Sync
* Tag pane: display your tags and their number of occurrences
* Templates: insert templates. This one is great, but the "Templater" plugin discussed afterwards is much more powerful
* Word count: display the word count

#### AI Plugins

Before we dive into the general purpose plugins I recommend, I want to cover AI plugins. By default, Obsidian does not include AI features. It fully relies on plugins to provide AI integrations. And if it's something you're interested in/curious about/absolutely need, then don't worry, there are many plugins out there providing AI features that leverage local or cloud-based Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, GitHub Copilot, and many more!

* Smart Connections: creates embeddings for all your notes and enables you to find related notes with AI, to chat with your notes, and much more. It supports many different AI models
	+ Link: [https://github.com/brianpetro/obsidian-smart-connections](https://github.com/brianpetro/obsidian-smart-connections?ref=dsebastien.net)
* Text Generator: generate text using various AI models, summarize notes, and more
	+ Link: [https://github.com/nhaouari/obsidian-textgenerator-plugin](https://github.com/nhaouari/obsidian-textgenerator-plugin?ref=dsebastien.net)
* GitHub Copilot: Integrates GitHub Copilot for chat and text completions
	+ Link: [https://github.com/Pierrad/obsidian-github-copilot](https://github.com/Pierrad/obsidian-github-copilot?ref=dsebastien.net)
* AI Tagger: Automatically tag your notes using AI
	+ Link: [https://github.com/lucagrippa/obsidian-ai-tagger](https://github.com/lucagrippa/obsidian-ai-tagger?ref=dsebastien.net)
* AI Summary: Automatically summarize your notes
	+ Link: [https://github.com/irbull/obsidian-ai-summary](https://github.com/irbull/obsidian-ai-summary?ref=dsebastien.net)

Note that there are many more, and new ones pop up regularly: [https://obsidian-plugin-stats.ganesshkumar.com/tags/ai](https://obsidian-plugin-stats.ganesshkumar.com/tags/ai?ref=dsebastien.net)

My favorite ones are:

* Smart Connections: I use this one for finding new connections, and chatting with my notes
* Text Generator: I use this one to generate and manipulate text using AI

#### **Calendar**

This plugin adds a useful calendar to the sidebar of Obsidian. It provides a simple way to navigate between your daily notes. I use it all the time instead of navigating through the file tree. At a glance, you can see the days for which you have taken daily notes. The second use case of this plugin is to easily create a future daily note. This is useful when you want to add a reminder for yourself.

Link: [https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-calendar-plugin](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-calendar-plugin?ref=dsebastien.net)

![](https://www.dsebastien.net/content/images/2022/12/2022-10-12-obsidian-plugin-calendar.webp)The Calendar plugin for Obsidian
#### **Periodic notes**

Using the periodic notes plugin, you can easily create periodic notes (i.e., daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly notes).

You can associate a specific template with each periodicity (e.g. a template for daily notes, another for weekly notes, etc). This plugin is also well integrated with the calendar plugin above. When you click on a date in the calendar, it creates the corresponding daily note.

With this plugin, [journaling](https://www.dsebastien.net/tag/journaling) is much easier to do on a regular basis, and so are weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly [periodic reviews](https://www.dsebastien.net/blog/2022-05-16-periodic-reviews).

#### **Rollover daily todos**

If your list of tasks for the day is part of your daily notes (which I recommend), then this plugin is a must-have. It will automatically copy the incomplete tasks to the list of the next day. This makes it a breeze to continue where you left things off.

Link: [https://github.com/shichongrui/obsidian-rollover-daily-todos](https://github.com/shichongrui/obsidian-rollover-daily-todos?ref=dsebastien.net)

![](https://www.dsebastien.net/content/images/2022/12/2022-10-12-obsidian-plugin-rollover-daily-todos.webp)The Rollover Daily Todos plugin for Obsidian
#### **Dataview**

Dataview is the most powerful Obsidian plugin there is. Using it, you can add queries to your notes to fetch information from your knowledge base.

To give you an idea of how powerful it is, take a look at these examples, taken directly from the [Obsidian Starter Kit](https://developassion.gumroad.com/l/obsidian-starter-kit?ref=dsebastien.net).

[![](https://public-files.gumroad.com/39uqrcaxowvpvf4srzeq97jpcecb)![](https://public-files.gumroad.com/zdjaf5bt0gfgsyljxmc3hoeaxv8l)](https://developassion.gumroad.com/l/obsidian-starter-kit?ref=dsebastien.net)[Gumroad](https://developassion.gumroad.com/l/obsidian-starter-kit?ref=dsebastien.net) 
Find quotes corresponding to a specific author:

```
LIST FROM #quotes and [[<% tp.file.title %>]]
SORT file.name ASC

```

Find recently modified notes:

```
$=dv.list(dv.pages('').sort(f=>f.file.mtime.ts,"desc").limit(5).file.link)

```

Find orphan notes:

```
TABLE file.ctime AS "updated"
FROM "" WHERE length(file.inlinks) = 0
AND length(file.outlinks) = 0
AND length(file.tags) = 0
AND file.name != "Orphans"
SORT file.mtime desc

```

Find duplicate notes:

```
// Reference: https://github.com/claremacrae/obsidian-experiments-plugin/issues/1#issuecomment-1139556976
function listFileNameIssues(dv) {
    let pages = dv.pages();
    let groups = pages.groupBy(p => p.file.name.toLowerCase());
    for (let group of groups) {
        let count = 0
        for (let page of group.rows.sort(p => p.file.path, 'asc')) {
            count += 1;
        }

        if (count === 1 ) {
            continue;
        }

        for (let page of group.rows.sort(p => p.file.path, 'asc')) {
            dv.paragraph(page.file.link + ': ' + page.file.path);
        }
    }
}

listFileNameIssues(dv);

```

Pick random notes:

```
const limit = 10;
const notes = dv.pages().sort(() => Math.random()).slice (0, limit).map(note => note.file.link);
dv.list(notes);

```

Count the number of notes:

```
$=dv.pages().length

```

And this is just the tip of the iceberg. Check out the [official documentation of the dataview plugin](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/?ref=dsebastien.net) for more details about its possibilities.

Link: [https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview?ref=dsebastien.net)

#### **Dataview Serializer**

This is a plugin that I've created and that adds a major feature currently not supported by the Dataview plugin. It requires the Dataview plugin to function.

The feature added by this plugin is the capability of automatically serializing dataview queries to Markdown.

When you write a normal Dataview query, "all you get" is a live view showing the results of the query. The output is never saved, it's just refreshed every time you look at the note containing the query. If you open that note with another editor, all you can see if the query, not the results.

With the Dataview Serializer plugin, you not only see the query, but also the output. This is powerful because it means that the data IS there. If you publish the note (e.g., using Obsidian Publish, Quartz or GitHub pages), then the data will also be there. As an added benefit, the data may also appear on your graph, which is mighty powerful.

Here's what it looks like:

```
<!-- QueryToSerialize: LIST FROM #quotes WHERE public_note = true SORT file.name ASC -->
<!-- SerializedQuery: LIST FROM #quotes WHERE public_note = true SORT file.name ASC -->
- [[20 years from now, the only people who will remember that you worked late are your kids]]
- [[A beautiful book is a victory won in all the battlefields of human thought.md|A beautiful book is a victory won in all the battlefields of human thought]]
- [[A busy mind accelerates the perceived passage of time. Buy more time by cultivating peace of mind]]
...
<!-- SerializedQuery: END -->

```

The first part with "QueryToSerialize" contains the query that needs to be executed. The second part, with "SerializedQuery", is added automatically by this plugin, and corresponds to the Markdown version of the query results.

Every time a note containing a serialized query is opened, the queries are evaluated again, and the serialized output gets updated. It's also possible to refresh the output of all Dataview Serializer queries.

I use this plugin extensively in the Obsidian Starter Kit, for instance for Maps of Content, Dashboard queries, and more!

Documentation: [https://developassion.gitbook.io/obsidian-dataview-serializer](https://developassion.gitbook.io/obsidian-dataview-serializer?ref=dsebastien.net)

#### **Templater**

The templater plugin is a powerful templating engine for Obsidian. It provides many functions to help you create really cool templates.

Here's an example, again taken from the [Obsidian Starter Kit](https://developassion.gumroad.com/l/obsidian-starter-kit?ref=dsebastien.net) which uses the Templater plugin extensively:

```
---
tags:
- weekly_notes
---

# <% tp.file.title %>
<< [[<% tp.date.now("YYYY-[W]WW", "P-1W") %>]] | [[<% tp.date.now("YYYY-[W]WW", "P+1W") %>]] >>
Current month: [[<% tp.date.now("YYYY-MM") %>]] | Next month: [[<% tp.date.now("YYYY-MM", "P+1M") %>]]
Year note: [[<% tp.date.now("YYYY") %>]]

## Goals
-

## Achievements
-

## Discoveries
### [[<% tp.date.now("YYYY-MM-DD") %>]]
-

### [[<% tp.date.now("YYYY-MM-DD", 1) %>]]
-

### [[<% tp.date.now("YYYY-MM-DD", 2) %>]]
-

### [[<% tp.date.now("YYYY-MM-DD", 3) %>]]
-

### [[<% tp.date.now("YYYY-MM-DD", 4) %>]]
-

### [[<% tp.date.now("YYYY-MM-DD", 5) %>]]
-

### [[<% tp.date.now("YYYY-MM-DD", 6) %>]]
-

## Challenges
-

## Gratitude
-

```

Once you have created a template, you can easily add it to any note using the `ALT/Cmd + E` shortcut.

Take a look at the [Templater plugin reference documentation](https://silentvoid13.github.io/Templater/?ref=dsebastien.net) to learn more about its capabilities.

#### **Auto Note Mover**

The Auto Note Mover is one of my favorite Obsidian plugin. It provides a way to automatically move notes around within your knowledge base. This is great as it removes the need to manually file notes.

![](https://www.dsebastien.net/content/images/2022/12/2022-10-12-obsidian-plugin-auto-note-mover-rules.webp)Auto Note Mover plugin rules for Obsidian
Link: [https://github.com/farux/obsidian-auto-note-mover](https://github.com/farux/obsidian-auto-note-mover?ref=dsebastien.net)

#### **Homepage**

The homepage plugin does exactly what it says: it lets you create a homepage for your knowledge base. I personally rely on this plugin to create my productivity dashboard. The homepage is just a note like any other, meaning that you can add whatever you want to it: text, titles, images, tasks, dataview queries, etc.
