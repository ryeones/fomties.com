which companies would do well over time but who exactly is Warren Buffett yes most of us know that he's the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway but how did he get to where he is today and why are investors so infatuated with them well as someone who spent a lot of time wondering what a Berkshire Hathaway was before university I thought it would be an interesting topic to cover these questions so that beginners can better understand Buffett's fervent following so let's explore who Warren Buffett is and how he 

came to be known as the most successful investor in the world on today's special episode of the plain bagel Warren Edward Buffett was born August 30th 1930 in Omaha Nebraska amidst the Great Depression in the worst stock market crash in US history during which time his father Howard Buffett actually started his own investment firm as a child Warren had an aptitude for numbers and a genuine love for reading which led him to go through every piece of 

literature at his father's office instilling in him at a young age a deep understanding of the value of money and compounding now like most children Buffett enjoyed playing games in competition but this manifested and Buffett as a love for entrepreneurship and the challenge of turning money into more money which led him to carry out a number of ventures through his childhood early on his pursuits while certainly ambitious for any child were more conventional starting at the age of 7 Warren went door to door selling Coca 

Cola and bubblegum to supplement his allowance and later shifted to delivering papers and even selling magazine subscriptions but Buffett bought his first stock at the early age of 11 and in his teens he started pursuing larger ventures investing his savings in farmland and even starting a business placing pinball machines in barber shops by the time he was 17 as a young adult Buffett knew where his passions lay and after finishing college he went on to study under Benjamin Graham the father 

of value investing himself at Columbia University value investing refers to the practice of using fundamental research to identify teeth stocks in Buffett had read a book by Graham and David Dodd another prominent investor at Columbia after failing to get into Harvard buffett wrote a letter to Dodd asking that he be admitted to study under the two famous investors to which dot obliged allowing Buffett to learn about stock analysis from some of the brightest minds in the field in fact Buffett went on to work for and 

develop a close professional relationship with Graham and it was from this mentor that Buffett actually picked up his famous two rules of investing rule number one never lose money in rule number two never forget rule number one outside of investments Buffett dedicated time after graduating to take a Dale Carnegie public speaking course well probably not viewed with the same esteem as his degree it's here where Buffett mastered his communication skills and became a captivating speaker in fact Buffett 

himself attributes much of his success of this course and if you visit his office in Omaha you'll see that it's the Dale Carnegie certificate not his Columbia master's degree hung proudly on his wall now equipped with the education to launch his career Buffett took some time to work for his father's and Graham's companies before starting his own partnerships and with his entrepreneurial capabilities and success growing money he quickly started accumulating wealth becoming a millionaire by the time he was 32 but up 

until this point Buffett had made most of his money employing a cigar but investment approach whereby he purchased troubled companies at a deep discount with the hope of getting one last puff out of them well this was certainly working for him Buffett's business partner and friend Charlie Munger would eventually move him away from this technique convincing him to shift from buying their companies at a great price the great companies at a fair price but not before Buffett carried out what he now calls one of his worst investments of his career a failing textile business in America 

known as Berkshire Hathaway you see before becoming the holding company we know today Berkshire was a struggling firm in a dying industry and while Buffett had purchased shares hoping for a rebound he eventually realized that the industry in North America was going extinct as fate would have it Buffett had a dispute with management over a 12.5 cent difference between what he said he'd sell his shares for and what management was offering him so in a moment of spite he bought the company and took over as CEO 

he eventually shifted the business to insurance and using the money the company had put aside for insurance claims Buffett began acquiring businesses and growing the folding investing in a wide range of operations including a chocolate company in California a mattress Mart in Nebraska and other more well-known names like coca-cola American Express in The Washington Post Warren's approach involved finding quality companies with a competitive product or service run by competent 

management and his method proved more than successful Berkshire Hathaway went on to become one of the largest companies in the world making Warren Buffett the wealthiest man alive in 2008 in his success brought Buffett a cult-like following annual meetings for Berkshire shareholders turn from a boring formality to what people today described as a Woodstock for investors with people literally traveling from around the world to attend Buffett's annual letter to shareholders and another formality of public firms 

accumulated a hoard of readers into this day are read by millions of investors who don't even own Berkshire shares Warren Buffett effectively became one of the most influential investors nay people of the modern era but while Buffett's investment performance certainly played a big role in this fame the truth is that it's not just the size of Buffett's wallet that's led so many people to follow his every move one thing investors love about Buffett is that he's continually sharing his wisdom in his letters and public 

addresses Buffett frequently provides guidance encouraging investors to focus on their circle of competence and teaching investment principles using analogies and metaphors that he's now famous for in the past he's explained the idea of investing in companies with moats something that protects operations from other businesses and he frequently uses baseball one of his favorite pastimes to explain the virtue of patience arguing that's better to wait for the right pitch even if the crowd is shouting swinging you bum now to be sure 

Buffett doesn't have a perfect track record but I think this makes Buffett even more human to his audience whereas most billionaires feel untouchable there's a lot of a Buffett that makes him relatable to this day he lives in the same house he bought back in the 1958 in his hometown of Omaha a modest city well separated from the high life enjoyed by other billionaires a CEO of Berkshire Buffett only takes salary of $100,000 a year a lot to be sure but pennies compared to the average CEO and despite his tremendous wealth 

buffett lives frugally driving himself around and eating McDonald's every day for breakfast to keep his meal cost below $4 there are also a lot of quirks about Buffett that many people find endearing he can play the ukulele and has serenaded his investors in the past he plays bridge with Bill Gates he absolutely loves coca-cola and it was just this year in 2020 that he finally upgraded from a clip phone but past the superficial points Buffett has demonstrated admirable values and a 

desire to do good with his wealth an impression left in him by his late wife Susan Buffett Susan wasn't involved human rights activists and heavily influenced Buffett's political and ethical views as a result he's long advocated for investors rights speaking out against the MAL practices of Wall Street in often couraging investors to use index funds to avoid the high fees of the industry taking his point further by betting that hedge funds could not beat the S&P 500 over a 10-year period I 

bet he won in 2017 he's also spoken out against gender inequality and even argued for the wealthy to pay higher taxes in fact wealth distribution has been a big focus of Buffett's over the last few decades in using his status he started a number of great initiatives every year for example Buffett holds a luncheon auction where wealthy individuals and business leaders paid millions just to meet and dine with Buffett himself with all proceeds going to charity but his most notable of philanthropy Esther is easily The Giving 

Pledge in 2006 after the passing of his first wife and not understanding why single man should have the amount of wealth that he had accumulated Buffett promised to give away 99% of his assets which today stands at an estimated 75 point 5 billion dollars with funds going primarily to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation a charity with a number of different focuses after becoming the wealthiest man in the world Buffett gave it all away and passed his own contribution Buffett encouraged other wealthy Americans to follow his lead and 

pledged 50% of their own wealth to charitable causes pack that over 300 people including Bill Gates Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk have taken this movement earned Buffett the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011 and the lasting respect of many people around the world so that's who Warren Buffett is one of the wealthiest men alive a builder of a fortune 500 company that today is worth roughly half a trillion dollars and philanthropist it's easy to see why so 

many people around the world adore him and why investors hang on to every word he says of course there are those who criticize Buffett particularly around his promotion of monopolies as good investments and he's by no means a perfect person that people should worship albeit some do but no one can deny his impressive achievements and the impact he's had on the world so next time you hear about Buffett hopefully you'll have a better understanding of why he's not just seen as another billionaire but perhaps the greatest
