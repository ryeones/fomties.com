## Full Document
the eight forms of capital as you've seen in the earlier section is one that was inspired from permaculture and with its such holistic view of money of wealth of the resources that we have as a society you see that it's not really just about accumulating one form of capital or the other but really growing in all eight forms and it builds greater 

resilience across the curation and the practice of all these other different forms of capital so when we think about wealth we begin to think about this Beyond just Financial capital or money or social or intellectual Capital as Society often Prides so perhaps when you rethink the Notions of wealth what other areas of wealth can you begin 

to build one of the biggest things I learned as I spent some time in New Zealand was finding that wow my Maori friends was so wealthy with the cultural capital that they had in the preservation of their language their native language their historical stories and and artifacts of how they spend time with their ancestors and also 

thinking through how the stories of the ancestors were shared across Generations and when I thought about my own ancestry and my own genealogy I realized how little I knew about my own culture it was really one of the first moments where I realized that oh my I am very not so wealthy in this regard when it comes to cultural capital it's it's a bit of a existential thing 

where you begin to realize that there are things that go beyond money like the essence of our culture and our heritage when it comes to our own families and and wow like how do you preserve them for the long run and that was really a turning point too when I realized that money can't buy culture in that sense I had to take time and invest time to learn about my own family history so perhaps for you it's in other areas 

it could be in experiential Capital where you're looking at building new skills to learn um to grow in a specific area it could also be a different form of culture in perhaps a Financial Capital right learning to manage your money better and to know the wisdom behind how to make money work for you perhaps it could also be in spiritual 

Capital so it's really an exploration in a time of adventure to begin to ask yourself what are some of the seasons in this life in this time that you would like to kind of contemplate and think about what forms of capital that you want to build that's relevant for you in this season of life and perhaps when you begin to identify a particular Capital you can also ask yourself why 

and go through that process perhaps even five times why would I want to build this particular capital and you'll be surprised at what fundamentally drives you and you can you know be honest with yourself as you think also about what are these forms of capitals for and why they matter to you in this season
