- Summary: REITs, or Real Estate Investment Trusts, are companies that invest in income-generating properties and distribute rental income to investors as dividends. They offer benefits like regular cash flow, diversification, and liquidity, making them an attractive investment option. However, they also come with risks, such as sensitivity to interest rates and reliance on management performance.

welcome to another episode of getting to know essay class today we will be looking at one of the favorite asset class for investors looking for passive income so what are reads and how do they work what are the different types of reads why should we invest in them what are some of the risks and how do we invest in REITs okay let's take some time to answer these questions read is an acronym for Real Estate Investment Trust it describes a company 

or business set up for a very specific purpose now imagine you have some spare cash and you are looking to invest in a house for rental income you can either do everything yourself or you can hire a real estate agent to hunt for that ideal house for you you pass out the cash and she will use that cash to buy the house she will also look after the maintenance 

of the house as well as being responsible for finding the tenants the agent will then pass on the rental income from the house net of all maintenance expenses to you and in exchange for all the work that she does she will take a cut of the rental income as her fee it is exactly the same for reads except the skill is much larger instead of an individual we now have a 

group of investors who are looking for income they invest their money in a read which is managed by professionals they use the money to buy up income generating assets they also become the managers of these assets making sure the assets generate as much yield as possible for the investors okay then they will pass on the income net of expenses to the investors by way 

of regular dividend payouts the rate will charge a management fee which is part of the expenses taken out from the income stream okay so the structure for most reads are essentially the same the only difference is the type of underlying assets owned by the reads the assets can be anything as long as they generate income let's look at some examples a commercial reads can own shopping malls and Office Buildings 

a hotel read can own Standalone hotels or hotel chains a medical Reit can own medical facilities such as hospitals clinics or even hospices infrastructure can also be attractive to reads because of the toes and fees that can be collected and infrastructure is generally seen as essential all right so in a modern data-driven world data 

center reads are also becoming quite common what are some of the advantages of investing in reads reads can offer stable Cash Flow by way of regular dividends and the yield tends to be higher than a typical Company stock okay unlike owning a single property as an individual owner buying a Reit allows you to own a diversified portfolio of underlying assets if you are trying to buy or sell a 

single property you know that it is not so straightforward because you need to find some interested party first right REITs however are typically liquid as they trade similarly like stocks on the exchange you can easily buy and sell on the exchange without needing to find someone to trade with you REITs offer a fair amount of transparency since the company behind the read is regulated by the exchange 

and is required to be transparent they publish annual reports just like any publicly listed companies which will detail all the financial information related to the assets as well as the company itself now bnq is a popular us read so I've used it here just to illustrate the correlation between wheat and stocks as represented by spy so as you can see they are positively correlated but the 

correlation is not perfect all right so reads can also offer some diversification away from stocks now what about the risk as mentioned earlier REITs are positively correlated to stocks hence it tends to go down during a stock market crisis as well and secondly REITs are also highly sensitive to interest rate okay due to the fact that the returns are purely 

derived from fixed income okay so therefore when interest rates go up the REITs fixed income become less attractive in comparison therefore reads prices tend to go down when interest rates go up and a read is only as good as the manager responsible for the reads so if the manager's interest is not aligned with the investor things can go wrong quickly 

now what are some of the ways that you can buy reads so you can simply buy them directly just like how you go about buying a stock but if you want some expert overseeing your reads for you you can buy read mutual funds however these mutual funds add another layer of fees that you need to pay for right now with the development of the ETF Market there are a number of Rich ETFs that you can also consider some of these 

are actively managed just like a mutual fund while some are just passive baskets of underlying reads and typically they cost less now you can refer to the link below for a list of read ETFs all right so this is just a brief introduction to reads but I hope you have cleaned some useful Knowledge from this video do smash the like button and subscribe to our Channel where we will constantly produce new relevant videos
