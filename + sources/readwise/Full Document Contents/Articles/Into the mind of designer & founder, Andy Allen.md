Andy Allen is a designer and founder of [The Not Boring Software Corporation](https://www.andy.works/), focused on bringing play, beauty and quality-of-life back to our everyday apps. As you might guess, this ethos could not resonate with us more. Always one to speak his mind, Andy kindly agreed to share his thoughts with us.

What’s the best compliment you received recently?

I’m bad at taking compliments so I don’t tend to remember them.

What’s the last game you played?

I’m catching up on old classics and just finished the DLC in [The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild](https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-switch/).

What game do you want to play next?

There are a few games in development that I’m excited about, like [Way to the Woods](https://www.waytothewoodsgame.com) by the 16-year old Anthony Tan and the castle-builder [Tiny Glade](https://twitter.com/PounceLight) by Anastasia Opara.

Best gift you’ve ever given?

I like to think of every creation as a gift to the world, and my best creation thus far are my three young daughters.

A quote that’s meaningful to you?

I have a mindless little phrase written on a post-it that I keep next to my desk that says “Do what you want, not what you should.” My kids protest and tell me I’ve got it backwards. I find it funny how we each envy something from the other—they’re training to become adults while I’m learning how to be a kid again.

Where do you want to travel to next?

Alaska — it’s where I was born and raised. Nothing will make you feel small like the scale of Alaska.

What would you buy, if money weren’t an issue?

Someone asked British fashion designer, Paul Smith, what luxury meant to him and his reply was, “Freedom.” If money is good for anything it’s to buy yourself the freedom to do the things that matter most and live by your own values. Funny enough, it doesn’t take much money to do either.

What hobby would you take up, if you had the time?

[I love woodworking](https://twitter.com/asallen/status/1617643320343420929) — designing & building furniture for family & friends. I’d spend all day doing it if I could and may yet one day.

What’s an image or piece of art you can’t get out of your head?

[Eran Hilleli’s Style Frames Opener](https://vimeo.com/190537820) is a feast for the eyes and just a world I want to live in.

The funniest thing you’ve seen lately?

I find podcasts to be where the funny is happening these days. I love improv and falling down rabbit holes, and nothing scratches that itch better than a stupid podcast like [Smartless](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/smartless/id1521578868).

If you could build an extension of your own mind, what would it look like? How would it work?

It’d look exactly like David Bowie’s endless maze in ["Labyrinth."](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091369/)
