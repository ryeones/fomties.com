## Full Document
- Men should be the stable ones. Men don't need to be
crying in front of women. And ideally, they're not splitting chores. And I don't mean that disrespectfully, but I think that if a woman cannot look
up to you in some way, then she cannot respect you. And if she cannot respect you, she cannot love you. - I totally disagree. - I totally agree. (mellow music) - [Host] Step forward if you agree with the prompt. Men are designed to want to sleep with multiple women. 

- Yeah, I would say I definitely agree that men wanna sleep with multiple women. I think it's natural because one of the things is because we have so much sperm, we produce so much sperm and that makes us want to repopulate the earth, basically. And so, a lot of times what happens is, is I think that society 

is telling men not to do that for whatever reason. You know what I mean? And some guys fall into that. But I definitely believe that men actually want to
be with multiple women because it is just a natural thing in us. This is why you hear all the time, you know, men always cheating and guys feel like they, you know, trying to hide the cheating and everything like that. And if it was natural for them to just want to be with that one woman, then cheating wouldn't even be an issue. You know what I'm saying? So that's how I look at it. - Yeah. I think for the way we were cultured, I agree with that, 

but also just through
human history, right? For survival. I mean, maybe this is old school thinking, but it's just like for survival you need to have lots of kids. So someone's pregnant, how do you keep multiplying? You just (blank) more women, right? - Right. - Not saying it's right or wrong, but it's just kind of the way- I think women even cheat, too. It's like 50/50. - Yeah. - I think women also wanna do their thing, you know what I'm saying? In some situations, you know what I'm saying? So I don't think it's just men. I think it's a natural- I feel like because that desire is there, 

it's a natural thing for, if we're talking specifically men, that desire to want to do it is natural in us, so then therefore you're gonna want to do it. So I don't think it's a natural thing to just be with this one woman, but at the same time, when I'm with this one woman, I only want to stay with her. It's almost like I'm lying to myself if I just want to be with her. You know what I mean? - Yeah. I mean, that makes perfect sense. But the question is, is that the end point? Is being with multiple
women the end point? I'm of the firm belief that it is important 

to position yourself as a man, to have the capacity to be with as many women
as you possibly can and position yourself in a way where you understand female nature and you maximize your potential as a man. And that's where I don't necessarily agree that just because there's a deeper desire to continue to do it, means it's going to be the most optimal thing for you and your own ability to thrive at the highest level and connect with God here on earth. - I was taught not to
be with multiple women. Right? But it's like, especially- I mean, here's the thing, especially when you're
in a relationship, right? It's better to grow together with somebody 

than multiple people, which I totally agree. But I think in the dating terms, it's like, there's nothing wrong with being with multiple women. Because I think that's just dating, it's experimenting, it's finding other people. But are we naturally made to just always be with one person? It's like, if that were true, then these first thoughts of being with another woman, even though I'm in a
committed relationship, would never occur. But it comes up once in a while, but it doesn't mean I'm acting upon it. 

- And you might be being generous about saying once in a while, it probably comes up quite a bit. - Well, it depends what kind of relationship
you're in, I guess. Or how good of a day it is, right? But I would say, for me, if it was totally natural, even though I was nurtured into only being with one woman, that these thoughts wouldn't occur then. - Right. And the thing with me, I'm non-monogamous, so I have a wife, I have a girlfriend, and I still, from time to time, hook up with other girls. You know what I mean? And the thing is, it feels regular to me. 

It doesn't feel like I'm trying to do it, or doing it because I'm forcing myself. It just feels natural. Like it's something I want to do. You know what I mean? And so to not do it feels unnatural. You might just want this one woman for a relationship. I can understand that. But sexually, though, I think it's all BS. - Yeah, I agree. I think a man can absolutely be head over heels in love with a woman and still sleep with other women and then not mean anything to him. And I think all men have the proclivity to wanna sleep with other women. Now, whether they're able to speak to that 

and actually act on that or not, or if they've been able to, like you said, religiously find a way to work around it. And I think religion has been great for that. Because if it weren't for religion, we probably would not have society. But I think what's most
important to identify, is that a man should
create choice in his life. And if you have choice, you should be able to do as you wish, particularly like in your case, like in my case, if there's no deceit. It's the lying. That, in my opinion, is actually the overall problem. When guys tend to go
outside of a relationship, 

they lie to the woman. That's the problem. - So when I was growing up, I was under the belief of just being with one woman, right? I was a virgin for a very long time, then one girl broke my heart. So that caused a lot of insecurity, resentment towards the other side, right? And then I just became a manwhore for a little bit. - The problem is, you have guys who are monogamous, but they're monogamous because they're forced to be monogamous. Meaning that they have no choice because they don't have the skill to attract multiple women. 

- And a lot of times they'll use that as virtue signaling. "I would never do such a thing." "Well, actually, bro, you can't." - [Host] All right. Can the disagreers step forward? - I remember when I would go on tour and things like that, my friends would always
try to encourage me to hook up with girls that were onto me, but I wasn't really into it. And it made me feel weird, like, off, like there was something wrong with me. 

And now I'm at a point in my life where I feel like I'm only having sex with multiple women so I'm not weird, so I'm "normal." I feel like even when I do have sex with these random women, it doesn't gimme any gratification. And I know that comes with random sex in the end, but I know in the back of my mind that I just simply don't enjoy this. I've been with multiple women and I've been with one woman, and being with one woman is just so peaceful as far as telling young men 

that they're born this way and that they should feel this way. It can really, not do damage, but just sort of make you second guess things about yourself. "Am I normal? Am I weird? Is there something off about me? Everyone else around me is saying that I have to feel this way or I have to do these things," but yet I don't feel the courage to do those things. - I would say that's not true, though. I don't think that we should promote men sleep with multiple women. I think that we should promote choice, and what feels right to you. So in your particular case, I would never tell you to sleep with multiple women. I think you might be doing the right thing 

to do exactly what you're
doing and not do it. Or stop doing it. It's not about pushing it onto young men, but I'll tell you, there's a lot of young men that have a demon inside and maybe are really upset and frustrated with themselves 'cause they feel a certain way. And it's like, "Oh, I'm coming out the closet. I'm straight." You know? Or super straight, or too straight, or whatever it is. I think that it's really gotta be about choice, man. So, if me to you, I tell you that if you don't feel good doing that, man, I wouldn't do it at all. - Yeah, I agree. In your situation, what was happening, this is what I think a lot of times, what happens is, you have guys who will have sex 

with multiple women 'cause they're trying to fill a void. So it shouldn't be about filling a void, it should be about you actually desiring. So you don't desire to do it, which is why you shouldn't do it. But there are guys who desire to do it, but then they're suppressing their desire and then it's doing the same thing as you not wanting to do it. They feel weird about not doing it, but they want to. Whereas you felt weird doing it but you didn't want to. - I think it's a society thing. Like what you just said, who's making them feel guilty about not doing it? Other men. The reason I think women and men, the question was, do you feel that men 

are meant to sleep with multiple women? Or they're just, you know, that's what they do. And I don't think that's true. I think it's a part of your character and who you are. I do believe that if you say, if you're gonna be
honest with your partner and your partner is into it, but do I believe that we are biologically meant, and it's in our head because we have to procreate and this and that, I don't believe that. I believe the reason we do it a lot is because it's looked upon as a great thing for men to have multiple women. Women are ashamed for that. Shamed totally. 

I have one son and two daughters and I know the difference of how I felt when they were 15. They're in their twenties now, they were 15 versus him having multiple partners or my daughter. - So if I could stroke a check for a million bucks and never feel that feeling again, I absolutely would. I really, really would. It's something that I
really hated myself for, and I felt very- I grew up in the south, South Louisiana, I was a Bible Belt, and I felt very distant
from people around me 'cause I had this urge in me and could not understand why I was so different. The biggest self hate I've ever felt in my life 

is over this particular subject. I thought I was broken. - And I understand you. And me, again, I'm gonna come back with, you know, just being around a bit. Me, I'm bisexual, I always have been. But like you heard me say, I've been married to a woman for 30 years, and I've been committed for 30 years. Doesn't mean I don't have that desire. It's my character to say, "This is my person and that's who I want to be with." - Now you're making it character versus the (indistinct). - Right. But then that goes back to, "Oh, we're just built that way." Because if we're just
built that way as men, 

then there's multiple people that I'm gonna wanna sleep with. - But I think what I was under the impression with that question was, are we biologically DNA created for that? I say, yes, but I loved, and I agree with what we're saying here. It's like, but as men, in the culture and awareness and being a human being, having a consciousness, choice, language, we can choose not to. We can go against those desires or urges and stuff. - If you feel that desire and you're honest with your partner, 

I believe that is true. Do I believe that we are biologically meant to, we just biologically wanna sleep with more people because we have a penis between our legs and not a vagina? I don't. - Well, let me ask you this, though, 'cause you said you're bisexual. That means you're attracted to men and women, right? - Yeah. - So if you are with a woman, aren't you also attracted to men, so wouldn't you want a man and a woman? - No. - So you're just like, "I just want one and that's it"? - I made a commitment. And it's not even like- - But there's no urge to want more? - There's always urge. 

- That's what we're talking about. - But that doesn't mean that I'm biologically- I think men and women both have urges. - Where do you think the urge is coming from, though, if it's not biologically inside of you? - I think the urge comes from- I don't think it's a biological thing. - I think it's temptation, not urge. - But the urge creates temptation, no? - But is temptation bad? Like, you say it in a way that's kind of like- - No, I don't think temptation's bad. I don't think it's a thing of- Then that goes back to all of us, then, all of us are meant to sleep 

with multiple people. Then that's just a whole
different society thing. The question was, as men, are we? And I don't think so. - But regardless, I think it's important to understand. I think we are, and if we can come to terms with that, we can begin to move past it if that's what we desire. But if we reject that idea that it's not natural, then we can't move past it if that's something that someone wants to do. - But do you agree it's just men? Do you agree with that statement that it's just men? - No, I think it's women, too. - Okay. That's where I disagree. - 'Cause we was just talking men. I agree that it's men and women. 

- What it sounded like was, and correct me if I'm wrong, people started talking about infidelity and telling the truth. I think the urges and things are okay until you act upon it. And that's when both adults just have to have a conversation about, you know, "This isn't working out for me, I still want to sleep around," or whatever you wanna call it. It sounds like some people want to have their cake and eat it too, which I don't necessarily agree with. And I think just as long 

as all parties involved have an understanding of what they're getting into, I don't see the issue. - I mean, honestly, I don't think I could say it any better than he did. Which I feel like most of us, or all of us, kind of agree upon that, in the end, it is a choice, that if you want to be in a poly relationship, that's fine, as long as everyone's in an agreement. Obviously don't, you know, be in a monogamous relationship and then, you know, single-handedly choose to sleep with other woman 

without telling your partner. Like, that's when issues arise. - Hi, this is Ragini, the director of this episode. You can now stream your favorite episodes of Middle Ground on Spotify whenever you like. Please like this video if you enjoy watching it, and subscribe to our channels. Now, let's get back to the video. Submissive Women are more attractive than dominating women. - Oh, hell yeah. (people laughing) Hell yeah. Listen, my shirt says, "Submissive women are sexy." 

Okay, so. - Yeah, it's true man. It's true. Look, I think one of the most beautiful things about love, is being able to fully
take care of a woman in every way. Whether that's emotionally, protecting, providing, everything about that. Every fairytale that was ever written for all of time was about a man saving a woman from a castle and a dragon, right? Or some sort of scenario like that. And I think that's absolutely beautiful, and I have nothing against
women being empowered, but I do feel like the
happiest women in the world are the ones that look up to a man and that he can fight
every day to love her 

and love his kids and his family and provide, and be that source of something to actually look up to. I believe a woman can admire a man, and it's very, very, very healthy. Am I saying that somebody
that doesn't do that is not a man? No, I would never. But ideally, the relationships that are gonna work, the relationships in, let's say the thirties, forties, fifties, or whenever we were
having nuclear families stay together before we went off the gold standard and inflation pushed every two people to have a job. Yeah, dude, I do. I think those relationships
were much happier 

when the man could lead a house and be proud of going out and going to work every day and fighting for his family. (beep) yeah, I do. - Yeah. I think what we have to do, is we have to look at general female happiness, 'cause that's really what I'm into. I don't really care what guys think and what girls think. And I think I have a unique perspective in that I've worked with a lot of high performing women that operate in this dominant role. And I work with them for the purpose of helping them be able to reintegrate with that more submissive, connected, intuitive part of themselves that really is connected to their bodies, that if they were
connected to their bodies wouldn't be as dominant, 

at least in the presence of men. And with every woman
that I've worked with, there is this deep, deep, deep desire regardless of what she says externally, to submit to the leadership of a man that she knows can properly hold down the emotional space and really put her
interest at the forefront. - Right. 'Cause as soon as when a woman is dominant over that man, she can't respect him. It's just impossible. - [Keyen] She can't feel safe. - Right, exactly. And the thing is with submission, if you even look at the word submission. Sub-under-a-mission. 

If I have a mission, and this woman is under my mission, meaning I'm leading her. Right? Then that is an actual good relationship that's gonna flourish. - Truly, deep down, every woman would love nothing more than to be more feminine in a role, in a family, and take on either that motherly role or that nurturing role, or the role that feels supportive to the overall mission of a man. It's just gotta be a man
worth getting behind, and weak men are the reason why this is a problem. Case and point, look at the workplace. You don't see women applying for jobs to be power line guys 

or hanging steel at steel companies. They're not picketing outside of the United States Army being like, "Why won't you draft me?" They don't want that (beep) smoke, bro. And that's okay. I can't say enough. As a man, you get to take pride in taking care of a woman, protecting women. What about your daughters? Man, you wanna protect and provide, care for them. That's okay. Let them be feminine. A strong man doesn't need you to be a man. He say, "Fine, you can be a woman. You're safe, sweetheart. You come with me." That's it. 

- There was just a few things that I disagree on. I think that, in 2023 especially, I think women just want to be able to look to the side and see their partner as an equal. And I think a lot of women now are- I don't think they're trying to be men, I think what they're realizing is that the qualities that they
were looking for in men, they've always had it within themselves. If women are submissive, it's mostly for, I want to say the validation for the man. 

I think they know in
the back of their heads, they know now that they can do things on their own. 'Cause I don't think they
necessarily need a man, but I think what they're looking for is that intimacy to have a partner. But I don't think that they require one. - Oh, no, they do. 'Cause, you know, a lot of these girls, they usually go home and cry at night from being lonely, from not having a man. They have all these things, and then they're upset they don't have a man. You know what I mean? And I heard you say that women want to be the men's equal, but you don't see, and maybe this could
just be a societal thing, 

a societal pressure, but you don't see women doing things that could make them equal to the men. You don't see the women
approaching the men. You don't see the women
paying for the dates. You don't see the woman being more assertive to the man. You see what I'm saying? So where's that at? - Because they got options. They got so much more options than men. - Well, I'll tell you what you do see. You see a high level of women on antidepressants more than ever. Right? And I think that's a bunch of women trying to cope with
trying to be like a man, when, really- Let me ask you a question. Are you more attracted to a woman that has a high-paying job 

or to a woman's beauty? - That doesn't matter to me. - It does matter. It does matter. - You asked me. (everyone laughing) - You could prefer a mother figure rather than a woman. - Absolutely not. But I would like to say that, you're saying that women have a higher, you know, have antidepressants. But men, I'm a social worker, so men, 1 out of 10 are more likely to experience depression but are more likely to go undiagnosed and not seek therapy or help. So I do think, and women also, you have to consider the fluctuation in hormones, pregnancy, 

'cause that can alter their mental health. So I think that's kind of a moot point, but I feel like, you know, I'm not looking for a mother figure, I'm looking for an equal. So I feel like with, you know- If we're saying that women, they're like going home crying, looking for men. I think it's also that societal pressure that tells you at the same time you have to have multiple women, they're telling the women you have to have that
one man, that husband, by a certain age, have kids by a certain age. There's more pressure on
them than there is men. 

And for, you know, lack of a better term, I think men have gotten off a lot easier because women have so much pressure and they get judged more
harshly than men do. For talking about back then when men used to go home, bring home the bacon or whatever, you know, the domestic violence rate was pretty high during that time. And I'll also say, that for people of color, we never really had the luxury of working one job. So, my parents, their parents before them, everybody always had to work. Men and women. So there was always 

that equal opportunity for them to be able to see that they could do it together as opposed to put that one pressure. And I also would like to ask, if you guys find submissive women more attractive than dominant women, is that because it makes you feel more validated as a man? Or is there something there that you feel feeds into
your purpose as a man? - Well, it's a balance. If I'm a dominant person, I need a submissive. If I meet a dominant woman, we're gonna butt heads. - What if that changes? Like what if she grows? 

'Cause I would love everybody to be able to grow throughout life. What if she starts becoming more dominant? Is that like a-? - You're saying if she starts becoming more dominant in our relationship? - More dominant or equal to your dominance. - Oh yeah, she's gone. She's finished, we're done. - And see that's my thing. Look, I got children, I don't need somebody
else to take care of. And I love your thing about, you know, the prince charming and everything. But you know what I need? I need a badass woman who can match my badass energy. I work with my wife, and I'm gonna tell you, I take care of her, she takes care of me, and she's badass, 

and that's what I'm attracted to. I don't need a submissive that I have someone to take care of. And then it's fine, if she goes to there, then I'll be there and I will take care of her. But I'm not looking for somebody, another child to take care of and have to dominate and tell, "You go over there, this is where we're gonna go to dinner, we're gonna do that." No. That's why what he was saying, I was gonna bring that fact up too, a lot of men are depressed 'cause they're putting on this shield of, "I have to be the leader, I have to do this." And you know who goes to get help first? Women. - Okay, that totally makes sense. I think if we're talking about men 

not ever dealing with their emotions, it makes sense for this argument that you guys are talking about. But I'm a firm believer, I have gotten a lot of therapy in my life, I've done a lot of things
for myself personally to resolve my own internal conflict. Okay? So it's the job of alpha men, the real integrated alpha man has the capacity to understand what he's feeling, why he's feeling the way that he is, articulating in a way that is productive to the dynamic. So a real man is someone that understands himself deeper at an emotional level, has taken the time to do that, so he can show up as a rock, not so he can show up more emotional. 

- Problem is, is that if you're super emotional, when we talk about the whole thing of being submissive or dominant, your woman is going to dominate you because you're so emotional. - Emotionally unstable. Let's say that. Let's stop using emotional, let's start using emotionally unstable. - Since you're so emotionally unstable, she's gonna dominate you and then she's gonna lose respect for you and that's gonna teeter the waters of the relationship. - So, I mean, you guys know dominatrix exists for everything. And by the way, I used to personal train a dominatrix. You guys are their clients. 

- Not me, cowboy. - I'm being serious. Like, it's a very hidden thing. I used to date 'em. High positions of power, very alpha. But like, here's the thing, I think you guys put a little bit too much
pressure on yourselves, it might be a societal thing. I've dated submissive women before. I find them highly annoying. Sometimes I just want
somebody to pick a choice. I like her places. She's got better taste than I do when it comes to that kind of stuff. So, please, go ahead. We do butt heads once in a while because she is dominant. But does that mean she lost respect or attraction for me? 

No, not at all. And trust me on that one. So I think it does depend on your energy. You have a very high one, right? Maybe it doesn't mix well with somebody who also has a really high dominant energy. I'm not saying that's wrong, 'cause they exist for a reason, submissive people, right? But I just think, for me, when it's very submissive, I don't find that as sexy. I find that annoying. - But see, and that makes sense. What happens is, the more masculine you are, the more you want the
woman to be submissive. 

The more dominant she is, then the more- - I don't know. I think I'm pretty (beep) masculine, dude. And I don't want somebody that submissive. - I'm saying that in that moment you're in your feminine. But go ahead. - If you and your wife have a conversation about a disagreement, and then you guys have
a healthy conversation then she ends up being
right in the situation, would you consider her dominating me? - No, I'd consider her right. - So what's your definition of dominant? Do you always have to be right? - No, no, no. It's not about right and wrong, it's about who's running the show. 

- So by her being right, is that not her-? - No, that's just her being right in that conversation. - Yeah, a good leader would allow someone else to be right. A good leader doesn't have to be right. He wants the team to win. In fact, I'd call a man insecure if he wouldn't allow a woman to be right on a subject she was clearly- - I like that. - I do like that. And it goes back to the question of like, what do you find more attractive? 'Cause that's what we're talking about. - Yeah, it's a preference. - It's a preference. One of the things you said is like, when you and your partner or girlfriend get into something, and it's a little heated. I get off on that. - Me, I totally don't get off on that. I don't need any back talk, 

I don't need any lip, I don't need any attitude. It's my way or the highway. I don't want none of this. - I didn't even have a conversation in the first place about the disagreement. - No, no, no. (crosstalk) - So you just don't want to be challenged. - No back talk. I am right. - That's a different thing. If we're talking about a topic, and she's right about the topic, that's just how- - It's like an opinion of yours or things that she disagrees with. - If you make an opinion, you're saying you want no back talk. - No, no, no, no, no. I'm not talking about opinions, I'm talking about decisions. 

So we can have a
conversation about a topic, but when it comes to a decision, the final decision is mine. - Let me change my wording. If you were to have a healthy discussion about a decision which she disagree with- - [Derek] She says, "I disagree." - Right. So if we say, "Hey, went to do-" She wants to do A, B, and C, and I say, "No, I want to do D, E, and F." Right? We're we're doing D, E, and F at the end of the day. Now, I will listen to what she says and if I think A, B and C sounds better, then I say, "Okay, yeah, let's do A, B and C." - But you don't want back talk in the first place. - No, no, no. - Even in the conversation? - No, that's what I'm saying. 

If we're having a conversation, that's cool. I'm saying the final decision, though, is mine. So you can speak your mind, but at the end of the day I'm making the final decision. - So it's like, "I'm gonna let you talk," but in the end, I don't really care. I'm gonna do what I want. - No, I said I care. - I do wanna touch upon the- - Let's clarify submissive, let's not get that mistaken between incompetent. Submissive does not mean incompetent. And I think you might have been talking about women that
could be incompetent, where they don't have the capacity to take care of themselves at all or make any type of decision. 

So I think there's definitely a difference in how she shows up in the relationship compared to being able to make decisions in her everyday life. - Sure. But he doesn't want
them to make decisions. - No, no. I didn't say I didn't want them to make decisions. - No, your decision's the final no matter what. - Some of the strongest women in the world right now are sitting in submissive roles because they're strong enough to think for their selves and do what they feel good in their heart. 'Cause there are women that do wanna be submissive naturally. And some of those women are the strongest women
in the world right now. Especially when the world's telling 'em to go be something that
they don't want to be. - I do agree that, honestly, it is a choice, it's a preference. You know? 

We shouldn't speak upon
everybody, obviously. It's always a gray area, it's a range. It's not one side or the other. And if you guys want
to be in a relationship where the woman is submissive and the woman also wants to be in a relationship where
the male is dominant, that's completely fine. But the thing I wanna talk about more is the fact that you guys keep saying that this is what woman want, or all women want this. Who are we to decide what woman want? Because, first of all, we're not women. And second, just because of our personal experiences in our lifetime 

about the people we've interacted with, I feel like that's something we need to take a step back from and clarify that. Like, no, this is just my personal opinion. In the end, we don't know what women want. Women knows what they want, not men. - I have yet to see a relationship- 'Cause I would say a relationship dynamic that is optimal has deep connection where you could say there's a deep friendship there, but also there's sexual polarity. And I've seen dynamics where there is a great friendship there and there is connection and they do live very cohesively, but when the woman is more dominant, the majority of the time I have yet to see a dynamic 

where consistently over time there is strong sexual polarity on her end in a dynamic. - And that's fine. If that's what you've
seen in your lifetime, that's completely fine. - Biology says that. I don't think it's just
my personal opinion. I don't think- - It's probably who you
surround yourself with. - Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Just because you've grown
up in a certain area where people are like that. Because I could say the same thing, but on the other side, where I've seen plenty of people and plenty of relationships where that wasn't the case, but then they're "sexually" fine. 

You know, they're perfectly fine, their polarity is completely fine and they're happy. And I could say the same thing. I could keep going at it. You saying that like, "Oh, because of what I've seen or what I've experienced, dominant men, it won't work." But then that's dumb because there are cases where dominant women do work, but there's also cases where it doesn't. - When they're happy, they're probably not going out saying, "I'm so happy, I'm dominant and I'm a woman." They're not going around saying that. Like, they're just happy, they stick to themselves most of the time when they're that happy. - [Host] I am great at sex. 

- [Justin] Come on, man. (everyone laughing) - I mean, I have a lot to learn. (everyone laughing) - So what are we discussing? (everyone laughing) - Prove it. (everyone laughing) - Prove it right now. - Bro, this was a chance
to redeem yourself. - No, no, I know, but it's just- - Actually I'm gonna go back. - With my partner, my wife, I'm able to not only connect physically, but also emotionally. 

And then I think that's the biggest trick I've learned. Not trick, but the thing I've learned about my years of being with my partner. You have to sort of keep the spice going. - I would say, you know, I think the fact that if you have a woman who keeps coming back, or who keeps wanting it, I think that's a sign that she thinks you're great at sex. You know what I mean? Because she actively wants to keep it going and keep it, you know, keep it going in that direction. I will say, though, I'm better at sex with women I care about. 

You know? So I think, me being a player and a guy who goes out and talks to a lot of different women, with my girlfriend or my wife or whatever like that, sex would be great. With the other girls, it can still be good, but I know that I don't really put in that much effort because it's almost like I'm masturbating with someone. - Eventually, you know your partner's comfortability, what they like, what they don't like, and that's how you make sex a lot better instead of sleeping with- - A thousand percent. Plus you love them. 

So you knew if you were gonna die today and you could have sex with one person before you die, it would be that person. Like, no matter what. You could have every supermodel, every movie star, everything. Like, fuck all that. I want that person. - Focus so much on what
they like, as well. You're kind of there to pleasure them because you care about them so much. - Right. - Which is why you would hyperfixate on, what do they like, what they don't like? And you can easily adjust yourself and put in effort for that person. - Like for instance, it's so true that you said that. 'Cause my wife and I, we have this thing we call "Love Menu." 

Okay, now why did we
invent the "Love Menu"? We invented the "Love Menu" 'cause we have three children! And they're only two years apart, they're in the mid twenties now. But you know, think about it, 2, 4, 6 at home and I'm working and she's doing her thing. So we found that in
our young relationship, sometimes the other person might be tired, but that's hurt feelings, that makes you kind of
do this type of thing. So what we did is we've come up with
a "Love Menu" of like, here's the appetizers. I might not be ready for the full course tonight, but here's your appetizer because I know you like this, or here's your dessert or here's your main course meal. 

And we broke it into those things. So when we do come to each other and we need that connection, it's not just like, "I'm tired, I don't feel like it." It's kinda like, "Well, what's gonna happen? Are we gonna have a
full course meal tonight or are we just gonna
have some appetizers?" And that's kept it spicy for us. And also, like what you said, making sure we're pleasuring each other. It's not just wham-bam, thank you, ma'am, I need to get my rocks off. But like, you know, how are you feeling about that, and how are you feeling about that? Because when you're in a long-term committed relationship, you have to do that or it dies. - Right. 

- And I love that. I love that you talk about the amount of intention that you live with in regards to making sure that you're always evolving with it, always making sure that it's spicy, you just care. I think if you have a genuine care for the other person that
you're involved with, then maybe you're not great right then and there, but it will eventually develop into being something that way. So I love that care that you demonstrate with that. - I'm interested in what you have to say. You've been very quiet about this one. - All he said was, "Look at the receipts." (crosstalk) 

- Look, that's a very
important thing, right? I think that, as a man, I hate to say- Actually, I don't hate to say. That you should come in confidently. And I do find, by and largely, it's kind of like you could have the alpha-beta argument. I do that thinking coming in kind of in a dominant way. There's a reason "50 Shades of Grey" is so popular. There's a reason it's the most read book of all-time. There's a reason there's detail in it. And I think you can say so much to a woman in sex without saying a (beep) word. You know what I'm saying? It's about how you touch her, how you have your hands on her, the way you take over her in that way. 

And that's okay. Just knowing and seeing that expression, and seeing things that happen as a result of that is enough for me to know where I stand on the subject. - The only thing I disagree with you about is, I agree with that energy, that take-control energy. And I think women do love that. But sometimes my wife
likes to take control and I love it. - Well, get up there, girl, and do what you gotta do. (everyone laughing) Hey, I'll put my hands behind my head, too. Yeah, cowboy. Hey, don't worry. But, by and largely, yes. 

And then when she wants- But even when you're all bottom, man, you still doing work, bro. It's all about dancing, bro. - I don't wanna get naked, but I have "sex" tattooed on my chest. Can I? - Well, it wouldn't take much. - It's right here on my rib. - [Derek] Okay. All right. And it's like a bold one, too. Not even like a, psss. - I think the biggest thing I've ever heard from my sexual partner is like, "Wow, you really caught me off guard." And I think that's a big part of it. 

- So is this like an argument with myself? (everyone laughing) - Tell us why you're terrible at sex. You missed it. He stripped. - No, I did see that. I saw it. I disagreed because I just feel like it's such a typical
conversation and belief that every guy believes they're great at sex. And to be real, when I talk to my girlfriends, none of them have good sex with guys. Unless it's, like you guys said, your partner, then you can get better at it, right? And you know what they like. So, that's what I mean. Like, I think I'm great 

with my girlfriend, but if I was to generate and say, like, "I'm great at sex," I'd be like, "Oh, I didn't- Almost every girl I slept with before probably never even got off really." But to say like, "Ugh! I'm great at sex! I can bring a dildo in!" I mean, I have nothing against that. I like all kinds of things. - I didn't mention a dildo. - Why'd you look at me like you did say it? (everyone laughing) - [Justin] I was
wondering why you said it. - No, I was just saying, though. - But you still looked at him. 

- "You look like the type." No, I'm kidding. I just feel like there's a lot for me to learn even now with my partner, and I'd just like to say I'm great. I don't say that to myself because I think that
blocks me from something that I might not be good at actually. - No, I agree. I clearly agree with the aspect that like, honestly there's always room for growth. You know? Going around and thinking that you're the best is not something that I agree with, but more so that like, 

especially with a partner, you actually wanna give the effort into. You learn. You know? It doesn't always have to go perfect the first time. You pick up things. Everyone's different, you know? Men and woman. So like, honestly- - When I think when that question says, "I'm great at sex," that to me tells me you could line up 10 girls, and 9 out of 10, you would know exactly
what to do with that. - Sometimes it's just a confidence thing. 

Like I am confident that I can achieve good sex. - Exactly. Right. That's what I'm saying. 'Cause the thing is, I look at it like, 'cause you saying, well, you can't really say you being the best, but I disagree. I look at it as, "I am the best, but I'm choosing to be great with this person." And so what I'm saying is, I can be really great with this one other girl, but I choose not to. And I do that purposely. And the reason why I do it purposely is because, like I was saying earlier when we were talking
about friends with girls and all that other stuff, is that women have to earn good (beep). 

That's how I look at it. You understand what I'm saying? So if I'm with a woman, I just met you at the bar and we're just hooking up, I'll give you something. I should've said woman should earn great (beep), but I'll give her some good (beep). But it ain't gonna be great because you haven't earned it. You're not my girl, you haven't done anything for me. - You're not gonna go the extra mile for her. - Right, exactly. I'm not gonna go the extra mile for a new girl. - I agreed with the- I agree with the mentality, but then not the- (everyone laughing) 

- I'm just not gonna do all that for a new girl. I'm not gonna do that. What I'm saying is, is that the greatness comes from within you to know that you can, but you have to make
the decision to do that. And I think once, and most guys, if they care about a woman, they'll do that because that woman in some form or fashion has earned that type of energy from him. And that's how I look at it. - I completely agree, but I just want to change the word, "earned", to something else. Something similar, but that means a little different. 'Cause like, you don't want to give 

as much effort to other people that you don't really
see like long-term with. But then obviously if it's a partner or someone that you can see a future with, you know that you can keep improving, you can be the "best" for that person. - Who thinks that great sex is more mental or more physical? Which one would you raise your hand? - Well, which one? Say one of them. - Who thinks that great
sex is more mental? - I think it's more mental. - Okay. Who thinks great sex is more physical? 

- The reason why I sat down and then I stepped back is because stepping down, I mean, sitting down, it was just kind of like that societal pressure of, you know, we all agree, like, men have to be really great at sex- And I had to check myself out of my ego and take a step back because it can't be 9 out of 10, it has to be 10 out of 10. I know I've had, you know, one night stands, and I can't account for
every single partner that I've had if they had a great experience or not. I could just be honest with myself and say I did my best, 

but you know, for whoever's gonna be my partner next, you have to have that
sense of open-mindedness in a way, because what they might think they want from you to make you great, you might not agree with even trying. I get what you're saying about women having to earn great (beep), but I feel like at the same time- - Why does it sound so funny coming out of your mouth? - I feel like I- I told you, I'm a comedian. I feel like at the same time, women's needs are a lot different 

than men's in bed. So what might be easy for you, like a quick one-two, they're expecting, you know, maybe more foreplay or more physical intimacy, and with the whole BDSM like "50 Shades of Grey," I think that appeal to a certain subset of women and their fantasies. But I don't think that accounts for all women. - I think it's a great fantasy, but I think if you put most women, like really say, "Do you want that?" They'd be like, "I don't want that." - Nah, they really want it. - [Host] Women should not be 

in position of power. - [Kevin] Game over. Just like his hat says. - I'm the only one. I think a woman can be
in a position of power only by herself, but not in relation to being in a relationship with a man. 'Cause when she's in a
relationship with a man, the man has to be the leader, the man has to be the one that's guiding the situation, directing the situation. If it's in any other situation by herself, 

with work, you know, with her friends or whatever, she can do whatever she wants to do. - [Kevin] Game over. Your game is over. (everyone laughing) - I first wanna ask, because there's a lot of like, has-to, have-to's, but like not really a reason behind it. Like can I ask, what's your reason behind why a man has to be in power, why can't a woman be in power? 

- Power is such a weird word. I would say more like the leadership role. And the thing is, is that a man has to lead a woman, he has to guide a woman. Because what happens is, when it's the opposite, when a woman is leading that man, she usually loses respect for him. When she's in a relationship with a man who is under her, who's submissive to her in a lot of different situations, then she starts to lose respect for him because she's looking for a man to lead and guide her. If you've noticed, they have sex with the bad boys, but then the nice guys
get tossed to the side. Like, why is that? You see what I mean? 

- Well, if you look at
them psychologically, they have past traumas
and issues probably. But like, look, there's women for you, right? I mean, like, you're on a different scale. What I would say, some women want a guy like you 'cause they don't want
to do anything, right? They don't want to take that position. I'm around a lot of women who don't want that. They're in positions of power, not just in work, career, at home. I know a lot of 'em. I do business, I find women much more pleasant to do business with. 

But when you're talking about maybe being at home, I don't know, I think when you get into your part, your end of the pond, it can get a little bit mucky. You know what I mean? And I don't really subscribe to that, as well. - I heard you say you were from New York. I lived in Manhattan for 30 years as a fashion designer, the heart of Manhattan. She was working as a fashion editor. I held it down with the three kids. I was the one bringing the money home. I was the one doing that. After my son, my youngest went back to school, she went back to work. 

I always wanted to have my own collection. She was like, "You should do that now." So guess what? She had the job, she paid the bills while I was building my company, so I could be strong in our relationship and be a man in our relationship. But I also got to know what it means to have
a partner next to me, and not someone that I have to lead. - Well, I think it's really, really important to specify what leading means. And so right now we're talking about, you talked about, we do the chores, sometimes she pays more, sometimes I pay more. I think it's looking at a really superficial level. I think what you look at in a relationship when
you look at leadership and the one that is following, 

per se, is, who's the one holding
down the emotional space? Like, who has the capacity to show up as the rock the majority of the time in the dynamic? And if that is the woman, I believe, for the most part, the polarity gets thrown off and there will be a deficiency in the sexual attraction that she'll have for you. If you are more excessively emotional and unstable than your wife, I do believe that's going to lead to issues in the relationship. - A man's job is to be the mountain that a woman's emotional waves crash into. Like, straight up. So, women are always gonna be more 

emotional than men. Men should be the stable ones. Men don't need to be
crying in front of women. And ideally, they're not splitting chores. And I don't mean that disrespectfully, but I think that if a woman cannot look up to you in some way, then she cannot respect you. And if she cannot respect you, she cannot love you. - I totally disagree. I totally disagree. - And the only reason I didn't come sit down, is because I have some really, really good women in leadership roles in my businesses. And they are absolute leaders. Now they might lead under me, 

but I think they stand alone as leaders, and I respect them enough that I would never come sit down over that particular statement 'cause it's too vague. But in the relationship, yes, sir, I do agree that a man
should be the leader, he should be the breadwinner, and he should be the one solving all the problems out in the world and emotionally at home. - I'm glad again that you two say, for work, it's fine, but when it comes to our relationship, I gotta be the one to wear the pants. Okay, let's not say pants. We'll use the person's words. I gotta be the mountain 

that her emotions crash into. I hate to tell you guys, we can be very emotional too. And I noticed a lot of guys in my 55 years that are way more emotional than some of these women out here now that are taking charge. So I think- - No, I agree with you. (crosstalk) And if you noticed, isn't it weird that nowadays they're talking about all these single, sexless men and all these guys having issues? Why do you think that is? - They're becoming more
emotional than ever. - Exactly. - No, I think women are putting up with less bullcrap. 

- I am not a sexless, single guy. - I'm not saying you. - No, no, I'm just saying this. - No one said you were. - My girlfriend is an
emotional rock for me. - That's what I mean. - I'm sorry, but I gotta strongly disagree with everything you say. I'm also a breadwinner right now. It wasn't always like that, though. She's going through a time and she wants to actually do something for herself and I totally support that. But when it comes to an emotional, whatever you just said, that analogy, 

look, I mean, I think that's the problem also with a lot of toxicity that goes on because some men, a lot of men have emotions, you don't know how to express it, and then it turns into
this opposite toxicity. How do I know this? I used to be one of them. - Me too. - It seems like a lot of these rich millionaires are the ones that have huge high divorce rates and things of that sort. And I think it's because they're just genuinely unhappy. Like, is your woman with
you for your security or do they actually like you as a person? And we're starting to see that like, 

yeah, women want me at first, but I don't think it ends well because after a while they want you for your security. They don't want you for who you are as a person and things of that sort. And that's why we see these millionaires and all these really alpha males getting high divorce rates. I think at first, it starts off with security. - Money doesn't make you alpha. No, not at all, man. (crosstalk) - I thought you guys would educate me, that's why I came here. (everyone laughing) - [Host] A man can just be friends 

with an attractive woman. - Can be. - [Justin] No technicalities, bro. - So I think it's all about, again, as we've been saying before, it's all about choices. I think if you find a woman attractive, it depends on, you know, are you gonna choose to pursue her or not? But for some of us, you know, if we're speaking from
personal experience, I've met many attractive women 

and that's not the only thing that I'm looking for. It's also about personality. So she can be a 10, but if the personality is just, you know, someone who doesn't challenge me on a spiritual level, emotional level, someone who also is
emotionally unavailable, then it doesn't really matter. - I have friends who like, I would consider very attractive, but then at the same time, when I think about it, I wouldn't be able to stand being alone in room with them for more than 10 minutes. You know what I mean? 

- I could acknowledge if certain female friends of mine are attractive, but doesn't mean I'm
sexually attracted to them. And it comes to a point where I see them as sisters or just such close friends that even the thought of them naked, like, grosses me out. 'Cause I just don't see them that way. I see them as very close, almost like family in some cases and things of that sort. And you know, sometimes you grow up with certain women and you see them as a sister or you see them as a close friend, and you just grow up and you don't see her like that. - Fundamentally, what's natural 

and what is possible I think are two different things. Is it natural to not be at attracted to a very attractive woman to you? I don't think so. But with a lot of intention with it and your priorities are elsewhere and you're very intentional with how you're showing up in that space, I think you can do it. And I think that was the question, if it can be done, not if it's natural or not. - If I'm attracted to you, honestly, I'm trying to smash. 

We gotta have sex and we have to be in some type of sexual situation, or I don't really want
to interact with you. On top of that, I don't believe in giving women non-sexual attention unless we're in a relationship. And the reason why, is because I feel like non-sexual attention from a man towards a woman is very valuable. So I'm not just giving you that just to be friends. You understand what I'm saying? Like, I'm not just gonna do that for you. And so what it is, is that if I'm gonna do that for you, you have to be under my program, 

which means that we're in some sort of sexual relationship between me and you. You see what I'm saying? So that's how I look at that. - I think that men and
women can be friends, it's just not because the man wants to. Most often it's the man who's trying to sleep with a woman. And he's trying to hang around long enough for her to slip up and make that happen. I mean, let's keep it a hundred. Right? So can they? Yes. And that would've been the technicality. Like when I saw you moving, I'm like, "Mm, must be something now." (everyone laughing) But overall, most of the time you're not gonna see a man be friends with a very overweight woman. 

You're not gonna see a man be friends with a very unattractive woman unless there's some kind of financial reward there. So, by and largely, I don't buy guy friends, particularly with any girl I'm seeing. It's like, yeah, right. - When I think about it, and I had a technicality
on the other side, because I'm like- Yeah, part of me really believes that can happen. But then I go back to
my experience in life, and my friends, it's really hard. I was running over there in my head, "Should I sit down?" But I was running all these scenarios from life experience of my friends 

who have said that girls and guys, 'cause it's not just guys, and it's never worked out that way. It just never is. And I think because- Yes, a person can be an attractive person and you not find that person attractive and you be friends- - You have friendship and attraction? - That's my thing. Part of a relationship is friendship and getting along. And then on top of it, you find that person attractive. - No way. - I just think it's a very rare thing. You know? Yes, a person can be attracted to me and you not finding them attractive and I can be friends with that person, but if I'm finding that, or if you're finding
that person attractive 

and you build a friendship- - And you connect? Yeah. - And you connect? - Then you probably wanna be with them. - Like I said, it doesn't exist, but to me, just, again, in my experience in life and just knowing my friends and people, I don't know one that
has worked out that way. - I mean, there's nothing wrong with your own experiences. Obviously, if that's what you've seen or that's what you personally experienced, that you yourself couldn't be in a friendship with a woman. Like, again, that's your personal experience, though. Whereas the question is, can a man, any man, be in a regular friendship with a woman? 

- Like a real, real friendship? Like they're actually really friends? - Yeah. - And he not wanna sleep with her and find her attractive? No. - Yeah, I think it's BS. - 'Cause at that point, like, we're also talking about- Now we're talking about, what is an attractive woman, right? Are we talking about just looks? Because, in this case, there are people who honestly don't have sexual desires for a woman who isn't emotionally linked. - I think it's, is she attractive to you? - Yeah. - I think that's like the basis of it. When you look at specific situations, so for some of these females that work for you, for example, if they're very attractive, 

I would imagine you have the capacity to- - I have a gift from God. Yeah, man, the second I sign their check, it's gone. - It's gone, right? So I think it's the
same thing with friends as significant others, as well. It's like, I have the ability to compartmentalize it where it's like, all right, this attraction, it just dissipates. - So is that the barrier that can make a man friends with an attractive woman? If there's that barrier of him being in the relationship or you working for them? - Well, first of all, we're not friends. You work for me. 

- Right. - I care about you fully. You're part of the family, but you work for me. We're not personal friends. And me and you will not be in the atmosphere where we're alone. - So when you go back to it, is it a thing where if you're both single, do we all think that you could be friends with an attractive woman? If we're both single. - Still no. - No. - I think no. - No. - [Host] A man should not cry in front of his kids. - It ain't popular. It's not gonna be popular to say this, 

but ideally you're not gonna cry in front of your kids. They cry to you. Is it fair? No. Is life fair? No. Is the dynamic between a man, a woman, a child fair? No. But personally for me, I want to take that responsibility of being the one that's stronger than all of them. And I'm okay with that. I'm okay with that responsibility. I want that responsibility in my life. I want to feel like I was a hero to them in every way. And I don't think a man that cries in front of his family is not the hero, but ideally I'm not gonna
be doing that (beep). 

- Right. You know, it's weird. I've never actually seen my dad cry till this day. Like, not even once. The kids are looking to their father for that strength. And so if they're seeing
their dad cry, right? I feel like that creates fear in the situation the kid has with their father. If you're crying in front of your kids, it's the same thing as crying in front of your girl. It's a bad representation of what you're supposed to be in that situation for them. - Now I'll tell you when I do cry. Bro, when you see one of those kids with down syndrome 

get put in a high school basketball game, he starts nailing threes and the gym goes crazy. Bro, I'll be crying my (beep) off. I'm so happy for the kid. It is like happy. I'm like laughing. I'm like, you know- But other than that, man, no, not at all. Here comes the heat. (Mr. Locario laughing) - Can the person who has kids-? (everyone laughing) - I have a father who I've never seen cry. So I get that. I was that man. Again, you have to understand 

my kids and my middle daughter who I'm gonna talk about is 26 years old. Now, for some reason, out of all three of my children, that middle girl from the time she turned 13 to 17, 18, we just butted heads, butted heads, right? And the relationship wasn't going to where it should be going. And I want to be close to my kids. We sat down, she was about 20, maybe 19, 20 years old, we had a heart to heart about our feelings and how we really felt about each other, and I cried. And six years later, 

seven years later, better relationship than we've ever had because she saw a human part of me, and not just me trying to be what you guys are talking about, which is a good thing too. My wife can count on one hand how many times she's seen me cry. I think my son had and my other daughter haven't. But I'm gonna tell you for that enriching moment, and that's again, just coming with years of having those tears with her and talking about how important it was that our relationship worked, and then hearing her come back and saying she felt the same way and breaking through that, "I'm the father, I'm gonna be the strong one", made her break down and both of us be closer 

than we ever have been. - Can I ask you a question about that? - Sure. - Do you think that if you could have set her down earlier than the age that you did, and just had a vulnerable conversation that maybe it could have happened? Like, it wouldn't have had to build all the way up to tears? - No. - She wouldn't have been
able to hear it or-? - No. Because what was going on from my understanding of our relationship, is that, you know, young people, I'm very independent, my children are very independent. They don't wanna be
controlled in a certain way. And as a father, you still have to keep that control. She was only seeing that side. So she was only seeing this domineering person 

trying to squish what she thought that she wanted to be or who she wanted to be. And that wasn't it. I was just trying to play the father role. I saw my dad do it, never a tear. He's that man, you know? And I was raised by that man and I took that on. I remember sitting my son down and telling him, "Boys don't cry." And I still to this day regret that. And I still talk to him. He's 24. I still talk to him about, I was wrong, because I do not think that's the way we're
supposed to live our lives. And I think that's why, you go back to the statistic of how a lot of men are depressed, we're supposed to have emotions. 

We're human. I don't believe every time you turn around you should be in front of your children (crying sounds), and your wife, like, you know- I think that's a drastic thing. But I know dropping a
tear as a father for me made our relationship so much closer and so much better than it would've- I'm telling you, better than it would've ever been. - You don't think you could've shown that vulnerability without a tear? - No. - My dad was capable of expressing emotion not from the standpoint of being a whiny little baby, he held it down in my family. My parents are the happiest couple I've ever seen, still to this day. 

But my dad was able to, and still is able to, at funerals, be able to show emotion, during movies when he feels the emotion, be able to show up and do that. I'd never see him whining about, like what you guys are saying, whining about just issues
happening in his life, like at work and what he's doing. Never. He deals with that on his own. But he is showing up vulnerably when he is experiencing an emotion, not from a a whiny baby place, but from a freeness that he has with it. And I even think, like, when I first went out to college, you know, he's tearing up too. 

- So I would just like to say, this is a field I specialize in. I'm a program manager for a nonprofit that focuses on mental health. And a lot of the times what we get in our clients are men that are coming in dealing with childhood trauma, of these expectations and standards of trying to live up to the "masculine" ideal. So a lot of the times we have men coming in because they're still trying to seek approval in their thirties or they're still trying to get that male validation, 

you know, in their forties. And it goes back to
making sure we understand the difference between regulating your emotions
and suppressing them. That's why I said earlier, to be an alpha, you have to be balanced. You guys can be emotional, as well. You guys can be vulnerable. It doesn't make you less than. Just like a woman being more assertive doesn't make her less than a woman. If you feel like you don't want to promote being emotional in front of your kids, you know, I've asked the question, does that kind of fall
into toxic masculinity for your son? 

- Well, first, I didn't say anything
about not being vulnerable. Vulnerable is the word that I brought up. So I think being vulnerable
is very important. I think crying, physically crying, in front of your kids is not ideal. This is not about an ego stroke or trying to be overly masculine. I think being vulnerable as a man is one of the strongest things a man can actually do. It's just that I don't think that crying particularly, sobbing, is gonna be very healthy as the leader and the person that they're supposed to come to for that safety and that care. - But isn't real vulnerability, then, you're just not being honest and be like, "Yo, babe, 

sorry, I had this thing. I left and I cried, but now I'm here to be strong with you." That's real vulnerability. - I can't think of a scenario where I'd leave to cry. - But needing feels performative. I'm trying to show you
how vulnerable I am. - No, no. It's not necessarily showing. - I think you can be very vulnerable without crying. - People just express their sadness in different ways. - You can be. But I heard what you
guys were saying earlier, and I agree with that. It's like, you know, you don't wanna be a crybaby about things. 

Right? But it's like, to be at, for instance, if I'm at a funeral and this person meant something to me, to tell me, "No, can't do that." Or I see something on television or a movie that moves me, like, "You can't do that." It's kind of like a very weird thing. And I think you guys touched upon that. - There's just a weird
stigma behind crying. Because it seems like we keep associating crying with weakness. And the issue is that, again, 

there is a big difference between crying and sobbing. Hysterically sobbing, I think that you should only do if you, say, lost a loved one, like really close to you. Say like your significant other, like, horrible accident. Stuff like that. There are obviously scenarios for that. For regular crying. Again, kinda like we
all touched upon that. We're not saying that you have to cry every other day, but there are cases
where it should be okay. - As kids we look up to our dads 

to be able to- How do we react to certain scenarios. Do you feel that like, okay, for instance- I don't think I've ever seen my dad cry. I've seen very sad scenarios, straight face, you know? And I feel like I developed that as a kid. As I got older, I have to keep this inside because that's how exactly just how I saw my dad do it. How would you basically
explain to your kids how they feel like they should let out their sadness? Should they keep- Especially if you feel like you're not really
expressing sad emotions in front of them. 

- I think probably the best thing I can do is explain to you what
my goals as a father is, is to explain them the truth of the world. Truly. "Hey, this is the truth of the world. This is how the world is. Here's some competencies and things you can do to set yourself up." Because my ultimate goal for my children is to have choice. So I can have a son, he could be gay, he could cry, he could be straight, he could cry. I could have daughters that were dominant masculine. I don't care, as long as they have choice. I personally, my preference, and what I aspire to be and what I want to be 

and what I get to be is that strong man for my family. - We all kind of believe that we have to be a hero for our kids. Right? Especially when they're super young. And honestly, I agree. I think you need to be a role model for your kids, you know? And you need to be a safe space, which I completely agree with. But things happen as they grow up, you know what I mean? Especially when they go
towards their teen years, when they start being more in touch with their emotions, when they're actually feeling a lot of different things and feeling the pressure of society and everything that's
collapsing around them. Sometimes they don't just need a hero, 

they need a father to commune with, to actually talk with. (everyone applauding) (everyone laughing) (mellow music)
