## Full Document
- I'm Nelson Dellis,
five-time USA Memory Champion and memory coach. And today, we're gonna be
answering your questions on Twitter. This is "Memory Support." [upbeat drum music] @GulaabZaamun asks, "Does
lack of sleep affect memory?" Yes, definitely. If you don't get enough sleep, you're not gonna be able to pay attention or have tremendous focus the next day. And focus is a huge cornerstone
of having a good memory. On the other side of things, sleep is super important
for consolidating memories. 

During certain deeper states of sleep, your hippocampus is
actually transferring data from short term to the long term. And if that process doesn't happen, you will potentially
lose that information. So it's a way to consolidate
that day's information for the long term. @joguy358 asks, "Does
memory loss or weakening always mean dementia or Alzheimer's?" Definitely not. Although I will say, if you are worried, I would consult a doctor. Just because you're
getting older doesn't mean that your memory has to get worse. 

My family has a history of Alzheimer's. My grandmother had Alzheimer's, and that's actually what
spurred this journey for me into the world of mnemonics. I didn't have a good
memory before I learned about memory techniques
and memory championships, and it all started because seeing my grandmother pass
away made me question, you know, is that my future? The encouraging message here is that we all can improve our memories. So if you feel like you have a bad memory or you're worried that
your memory is aging, you can turn it around. @bobbymeow asks, "How the
[beep] can someone solve 

a Rubik's cube blindfolded?" So what people will do is
they'll assign each of the pieces a letter of the alphabet. So technically, each part of
each piece has its own letter. So the top here might be an A, whereas the back here might be a Q. And if you can remember the sequence in which the pieces need to be solved, you can create a sequence of letters which could equate to a series of words. @BarnabyFarn asks, "How the actual [beep] does memory work?" 

So it used to be thought that
memories were stored entirely in the hippocampus which is
a part of the brain parallel to your ear, about the size of your thumb. Recently, they discovered
that, actually, different kinds of memories are stored in
different parts of the brain. @Orbital\_Railgun asks,
"What the [beep] is it about moving that totally wipes my memory? I get up to do something, and I instantly forget
what that thing was." So there's an interesting
study that was done by a psychologist at Notre Dame where he talked about this phenomenon that we forget things when
we move through doorways, 

when you open the fridge and you forget what you opened it for, or you walk into a room
and you forget what you were walking in there for. We forget things where we
cross an event boundary. And so there wasn't
really any solution to it other than maybe when you're
trying to memorize something, stay where you are rather
than crossing some kind of barrier mid learning or mid memory. @Casuallycruelme asks,
"How [beep] I can memorize Taylor Swift lyrics but
not physics formulas?" There are a few things at play here, one is procedural memory. 

That's basically muscle memory. When you sing a song or listen to a song over and over again, you are building it into
your long-term muscle memory. Second at play here is
the emotional response. You're connecting to
her music, her lyrics, the way it makes you feel, and that's a lot more
interesting than say, a physics formula. And then the third thing
at play is encoding. The way that the song is structured, the beat, the rhythm, the way things rhyme lends itself to being easier to memorize. @HashtaglifeGreg asks, "Got any hacks for how to remember a list of 11 items?" 

Let's say you wanna remember
a list of grocery items. All right, let's say that
we have asparagus, bread, bananas, sour cream, and coffee beans. To memorize that list,
we can use a technique called the linking method
which basically takes each of the items on our list,
turns them into some kind of fun interactive image, and connects it one by one
to the next one on the list. So maybe this is how we picture it, right? We have asparagus, so maybe
I take those asparagus spears and stab the bread and
break it down into pieces, 

and it reveals that there
was a banana inside. I then peel that banana and maybe some sour
cream liquid just pours out of it, right? And then finally, maybe I
scoop up that sour cream and just dump it in my coffee which is filled with coffee beans. So that list would be asparagus,
bread, bananas, sour cream, and coffee beans. And what we've done is each
of those individual images has a element of a story
that connects it or links it to the next thing in the list. @jjpierce\_ asks, "How do you
memorize lines overnight? 

Asking for a friend." Yeah. So there's this technique I call the first letter method. And basically, you take a passage that you're trying to memorize and you read it a few
times, then write it down, this is important, just the first letters of each word as they show
themselves in the actual text. Then, you'll be surprised
that you can actually read from that first letter only script and remember the full
words for the whole thing. You do that a few times,
then take it away, close your eyes and see
if you can remember it. And most times, like nine times outta 10, 

you'll have the whole passage memorized. @archanaHJ asks, "Is there a correlation between exercise and memory?" Yes, both indirectly and directly. Indirectly, being fit and
working out and exercising makes you feel good. It lowers anxiety, reduces
stress, improves sleep. All of those things improve your memory. And then directly, it improves
blood flow to the brain, it reduces inflammation in the brain, and it encourages brain health. Alex\_Frandisco asks,
"What is a memory palace, 

and how do you make one? Inquiring minds want to know." All right, so a memory palace, it's a technique where
you use a physical space that you map out in your mind, and you place images for
the things you're memorizing along that pathway. Some of the best memory
palaces are gonna be places that you're super familiar with. And then when you wanna
recall the information, all you gotta do is go back to that same physical space in your mind and walk through the place. So let's say that you wanted to memorize the five largest countries
in the world in order. 

Those happen to be Russia,
Canada, USA, China, and Brazil. Since we're doing this together, maybe we could use this table. Now, our pathway that
we're gonna decide on is gonna start at the brain
and make its way to this side of the table to the headphones. One image per location. Now, in terms of what are
we putting on each location. Well, with countries, you can maybe think of an association that's natural to you. For example, for Russia, I
might think of a martini, a vodka martini. So I would imagine maybe on the brain, is a balanced martini
glass filled with vodka. 

Then I go to the next location. I'm on the laptop, and we
have to memorize Canada. When I think of Canada, I
think of a hockey stick. They play a lot of hockey, right? So maybe a hockey stick
is just slap shotting the crap outta this thing
and sending it flying into the wall and exploding into bits. Next one would be the third
location, the deck of cards. An association for USA, I might
think of, like, a hamburger. So maybe I would imagine instead of an actual burger patty in my bun, but it's a deck of cards stuck in there. Next, we go to the fourth location and that would be the
fourth thing that I'm trying to memorize which is China. 

I think of chopsticks for Chinese food. So I'd have to incorporate
that image with this object. So I'd imagine maybe picking
this up with chopsticks and having a hard time
kind of rotating the cube, trying to solve it. And then finally, the last location here would be our Brazil. When I think of Brazil,
I think of soccer ball. They play soccer really well. So I would maybe imagine
putting these headphones around a soccer ball so he
can listen to some jams. Now, we've just memorized the list. Doesn't really feel like it, but if we wanted to remember
the list and recall it, 

we just go back through
our little memory palace and pull up the images that we left there. Martini, Russia. Hockey stick, Canada, Burger, USA. Chopsticks, China. Soccer ball, Brazil. What's kind of beautiful
about this technique is that you can say that list now forwards or you could say it backwards, or you could jump to any location and get any piece of
information as you want it. @abdoviper asks, "How to
memorize a deck of cards?" At the Memory Championships, one of the events is to
memorize a full 52-card deck 

in sequence as fast as possible. Now, the way I do that, I do a combination of changing the cards into images and then storing them in a memory palace. How do I come up with the images? There's a system called the PAO system, person, action, object. Every card, I've given
a preset person, action, and object to. So whenever I see it,
I don't see the card, I see the person or the
action associated with that or the object. And for every three cards, 

I group them into this mini scene. The first card's always the
person, the second card's always the action or the verb, and the third is the object. So to take an example,
the first card that we had was Eight of Clubs which
to me, is Bear Grylls, the action adventurer guy. I probably can't even
remember why it became that, but there was a reason. Whenever I see Eight of
Clubs, it's Bear Grylls. It feels like I'm looking at him. It's so ingrained. Then this next card is
the second in a sequence of three, so it's the action. And my action for Four
of Hearts is urinating. 

So we have Bear Grylls urinating. And then, the third card
in this set, Ace of Clubs, is a thong. That's my image for it. So I have Bear Grylls
urinating on a thong, weird but memorable. And I place it in one
of my memory palaces, the first location of which
is my high school bedroom. I imagine that action,
that little story happening in a location at a memory palace. Then we go into the next location. Essentially, it's a person,
action, and then an object. And then do that for every
subsequent set of three. 

And I move through my memory palace as I place down those
different sets of images. And then I continue that
process for every subsequent set of three until there's no more cards left. Seven of Diamonds, King of Spades, Two of Spades, Ace of
Spades, Three of Spades. You get the idea. @TanviiAgarwal asks, "How
are bad memories so, so clear and exact in our minds but
happy memories fade away?" Back in the Medieval ages,
they would throw kids in the river after memorizing something, 

and it was so that they
could actually remember the information better because
their adrenaline spiked right after learning. And there are studies that
show that in situations of high stress or where
your adrenaline is peaked, you're actually gonna remember
that information better. @summerahrens asks, "How
does memory have fragrance? Like, why can I summon the smell
of fall 2019 into my brain? Explain how I can smell
my kindergarten classroom, but I don't know what I did yesterday." So smell is one of the earliest
evolved senses in our brain, and it actually bypasses this
thing called the thalamus 

which is responsible for
kinda delegating information between different parts of the brain. So technically with smell memories, they go directly to either the
amygdala or the hippocampus which are responsible for
dealing with memories. That's why usually smell
memories are so intense and so instant. @EverydayInnovtr asks,
"Anyone ever competed in the United States Memory Championship?" Yes. [chuckles] Many times. I'm the five-time USA
Memory Champion winner. This is actually the trophy that I got 

from my most recent win last year. It's in the shape of a seahorse which is what the hippocampus looks like. The competition is pretty
interesting in itself. It's a day-long event where we basically memorize useless stuff. Decks of playing cards,
huge phone numbers, lists of words, names and
faces, poetry, and more. And basically, whoever
can memorize the most, the fastest and the most accurately, becomes the USA Memory Champion. @yours\_nottruly asks, "How
do you remember passwords? 

Are you mind mapping like Holmes?" First of all, a password
has to be memorable, but it also needs to be secure. One of the best ways to do
it is to choose a sentence that is funny, or weird,
or bizarre to you. Nelson Charles, that's my middle name, Dellis rocks my socks off. Take that sentence and just break it down into the first letters. Capital N, capital C, capital D, lowercase R, M, S, O, 

exclamation. Keep things that were capital, keep things that were lowercase. And there you have a
pretty complex password. It's not my actual password by the way. @abovoadmala asks, "How
are mnemonics helpful? It's just a second thing to memorize." When you use mnemonics
and the proper technique, you're taking advantage of things that our brains are really good at, namely, thinking in pictures. We remember pictures way
better than anything else, pictures that have meaning to yourself. And then secondly, spatial
orientation or organization. 

How do you structure the images or things that you're memorizing? If you have a way to do that, you're making your life much easier. @charlieweather\_ asks, "How do
you remember people's names? Really tired of feeling like
I'm disrespecting everyone I meet all the time." This is probably one of the
most common questions I get. It's only normal that
when we're meeting people, we're probably thinking about
the smart thing we wanna say or looking cool, but
we're not paying attention to the person in front of us who's about to tell us their name. But there is a technique, and I actually am pretty good at this. This is one of the
records that I still hold. 

So let's do an example. I've been given 25 different faces here, all hiding a name behind the photo, and I'm gonna take a minute
or two to look this over and memorize them. First, you turn the name into a picture. I would look at the person's face, find something quick
about them that I notice. Usually the first thing that comes to mind whether it's pretty
eyes, a distinctive mole, a big red beard. So for this guy Oliver,
I think of Oliver Twist. So I thought of me twisting
his beard pretty forcefully. 

He doesn't look too pleased about it in his expression there. So it kind of makes the
image a little more funny. Then I just repeated that
process through all 25 names, and I did a quick review just to make sure that I had it solidified. Okay, so that took me
about a minute or two, and let's see if I can get them all right. So this guy is Max. This girl is Georgia. Sandy. Virginia. Stan. Tara. 

Lucas. Todd. William. Sean. Alma. Akash. Camila. Sophia. Emma. Sara. Elijah. 

Carmela. Eric. Carla. Keith. Noah. Mara. Cindy. And Oliver. There we go. @BradleyLeese asks, "What
is your favorite resource for training your memory
for tests and quizzes?" There really are three
ways to get something 

into your long-term memory,
one is spaced repetition. So spacing out over time the things, the study sessions basically, what you're trying to
memorize, give it some room. So cramming's not a good idea. The second thing is interweaving. So in between sessions you actually study something totally different and then come back to the information you were trying to remember. That's also very effective. Third would be active recall. So actually trying, actively,
to remember the things that you're trying to remember. That sounds pretty obvious, 

but you'd be surprised
how many people just look at the thing they're memorizing and think that they'll
have it in their memory just by going through
it over and over again. When you put that thing away,
and you just close your eyes, and you really try to get
it, even if it's not perfect, that process is so effective. @aphrodiddy asks, "Anyone know foods that improve your memory?" Yeah, there's a few. Avocado, blueberries, broccoli,
turmeric, dark chocolate, and walnuts. I think the main one that
I would encourage people to investigate is
omega-3, DHA specifically. It's a fatty acid found in the brain. 

We don't get a lot of it in our diet, but we need it to help
improve our brain health. So you can get that from fish oil pills. There are certain foods that have it like fatty fish like salmon. @BipolarBearDick says, "Prevagen
says it'll help your memory because it contains jellyfish. Do jellyfish have good memories?" I don't know specifically about Prevagen, but there's a lot of
kind of snake oil type brain supplements out there. Often they're referred to as nootropics. Some don't really have any proof or the research is very
weak or not proven. 

The best pill you can take
to improve your memory is not a pill at all. It's just better diet,
better sleep, more exercise, and using your memory. So those are all the questions for today. I hope I inspired you a little
bit to start your journey into the world of memory. Thanks for watching "Memory Support".
