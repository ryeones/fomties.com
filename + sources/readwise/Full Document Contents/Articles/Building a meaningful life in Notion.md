## Full Document
[Music] please welcome Mike and Maddie [Music] Kenny thanks for being here everyone let's go ahead and get started um first question show a hands anyone in here like video games okay oh awesome so this is just for you talking about how video game Frameworks can give you an advantage in life because it did for us 

so let's begin my name is Mike that's my little brother Maddie and several years ago we were working full-time as doctors and it was during this time that we started a little YouTube channel and it was about productivity and study tips so fast forward to 2022 we did something that most doctors don't do at this point except for this guy we both left our careers in medicine to go full-time on YouTube 

and it's every Asian parents worst nightmare take that multiply by two because they lost two sons that year but things went well last year we hit a million Subs this year we hit our first million Revenue you can see us happy showing our notion template because it played a big part in this and so these are the levels of our game this is the game right here and every level you go through it becomes more clear who you want to become so so think back into 

your life right past 10 years what are the levels that you have conquered college grad school right your first job maybe and every level you go through it gets a little bit more challenging Stakes get higher right it gets more difficult you start to adult pay the bills have families and so it's important to pay attention to Knowledge and Skills along the way that's how you keep playing at a good rate and these are the upgrades so it's not just that though you have to pay attention and bring with you the skills from previous 

levels right skills stacking it's a concept that's easy to understand right children understand this that's why they're so good at video games but after working with so many clients we notice a big problem and the problem is this is that people start the next level as if they're playing a brand new game right they don't bring with them the skills they don't load the last save file and so I'm going to pass it off to Luigi 

here for a little story of what we mean thanks yeah Luigi I'm the little brother so a few years ago when I was in medical school I had to apply for summer internships because that's what medical students do and there was actually this program I really wanted to go to which also happens to be here in San Francisco so I did all this prep work I shot my shot submitted the application and I heard nothing back for a few weeks about 6 months later like the day before my final exam I get a call from out of the the blue from the program 

that they had a spot open up and they wanted to interview me so obviously I said yes absolutely this is a great opportunity um but it was going to be tight so I was on the east coast and programs on the west coast so there's already a time difference there so I had to get up really early for this and so I was like well you know I got to get to work and so I open up my computer and my stomach drops because this is what I see did anyone else's workspace look something like this or used to before you found notion so I had a whole bunch of files just everywhere my 

workspace was chaos even in notion I had all these like Untitled documents I didn't really know where they come from and toggles and stuff um terrible so it took me like an hour I Tred try to find anything I could in that workspace eventually I just got so fed up I was like I'm just going to have to start over I youtubed again you know how do I say this interview question I did some research into the program in all that stress I did not get the internship did not beat the level and when you let an opportunity like that pass you by because of 

something like this it will haunt you for the rest of your life clearly I'm not over it yet um but my point is that most of us think that the goal is to get the job done right and so we do all this work and we get the job done but we leave chaos behind us like I just showed you but I think it's a lot more important that we build a system so that that never is a problem ever again because otherwise we just get stuck right that's why we end up like this we playing the same level over and over we get stuck in 

jobs we don't like careers we don't like maybe our business won't grow and eventually it's game over but if you guys are here listening right now then we want to show you a science-based system that we developed so that never happens again and you can get your star power do you guys want to see the system cool let's go into it so here's the system it's very simple it goes we work on projects we clarify our priorities and we track our progress and we designed it to be simple because 

normally you can get away with being a little bit chaotic and disorganized if you're working on your own but the moment that you work with someone else like we build a business together then the work gets really messy and the chaos piles up a lot faster than normally would but by running it through this system we can pretty much turn any problem in our business or in our careers from this messiness into a clear path forward and so a few examples of how we done this in our business every single YouTube video we work on together 

things like hiring Talent building Sops training team members even this presentation that you guys are watching right now all this was a project with priorities and progress and the best part is since we're all here is that all this lives inside of notion right and so notion is like our game backpack in the game it's our inventory we can pause the game we can see what have we done so far we can reuse what we've learned before because I firmly believe that if you beat enough levels in life you get to live a meaningful life and so for the 

rest of our short time together here we're going to double click into the system and we're going to talk about why projects solve all your problems how priorities create possibilities and how to actually make progress and I'm going hand it back to Mike so when I was in college I thought about my life in problems and I had this really big problem right so I love to travel Adventure go sightseeing um go out go partying do all these things that a college student would want to do right but my problem was I had no money to do 

any of those things so problem how to get money do some research ask around and my best friend says dude you should just get a job easy right so problem now becomes just get a job so I started thinking about this and all these other problems start popping out of nowhere right like where do I get a job how do I find one what kind of job freelance part-time I'm in school how do I make time for a job it got pretty overwhelming at one point 

I thought is my problem just ask my parents for money and so what did I do I basically did nothing for two years and the reason was because I didn't know what to do we don't take action when it's unclear what needs to be done next so what I learned is that confusion creates chaos and Clarity creates Focus what I mean by that is cognitive low Theory by John sweller 

it's just a fancy way of saying that it's the mental effort used to think about something so for example information that's clear and concise means that it's less mental effort and then more productivity for you reverse is also true information that's unclear or too much overwhelming it means less productivity for you so if you look back at this if confusion creates chaos and Clarity creates Focus then it's problems that create confusion and projects that create clarity so that's why we want to think 

about it in this way this is your brain when you think about life as problems right pieces are everywhere it's overwhelming how do I get a job where do I find a job and it's not really clear what you're supposed to do next but this is your life when you think about it in projects very structured organized you know exactly what to do next so the way we teach it to our students is this four step framework the four DS of every project they are deliverables deadlines documentation and to-dos it's what you 

do when you do it where do you store the information how do you do it and when you start thinking about your life in these four components then you start to see that Clarity is not black and white right it's not is this clear yes or no it's actually how clear is it so on the Spectrum this is not very clear this is more clear and this is even more 

clear and then this is the most clear in notion so I'm going to hand it off to manie to show how we do a notion sure so inside of notion these are the 4ds that we said we all know how to use notion here I hope notion is organized by databases databases are groups of pages and inside of each database page we have properties so the way that we've organized this that's been successful for us we split up the properties into um this top part here which is deadlines vbl and then we also use related 

databases below and there's a reason why we use related databases the reason why it's better so most people organize their Digital Life very linearly right we put files and folders and folders and folders you got to go to Cod dig in a straight line to find what you need but the way that our brain actually stores information and uses information is it's more like a web right everything's kind of connected together you think about one project it kind of opens the door to all these other projects and so that's how we should store information as as well one project is probably useful for 

multiple projects that you work on even some documents that you create might be useful in multiple projects as well and using notion database system we have the flexibility to do that and also keep things organized in whatever fashion we want to so for us we just keep it really simple this is our project database we have I Circle here the three related databases that we use you kind of them all together just like that inside the page itself at the top we have very clear deadlines very clear deliverable and we have linked database views below 

so you can see exactly what you need associated with the project this is for us a simple system even anyone we bring on the team can get on board with this really fast a lot more clear and uh less cognitive load all right let's go on to step two which is how priorities create possibilities any doctors preds Med students in the room anyone familiar with medical application process all right one person in the back there we're going to reveal some juicy Secrets 

right now so Maddie and I we both used to be on the med school admissions committee so we were responsible for deciding who gets into Medical School otherwise we make or break your dreams essentially and the application process is quite uh complicated so this is what you need you need a four-year degree from a university good GPA good mcast score all the Premed classes you need letters of wreck you need need personal statement 

clinical experience volunteer experience research experience leadership experience secondary applications interview and so it's a lot of things to think about right and we've looked through hundreds of applications and we saw that they usually fell into three very distinct buckets these are the three types of applicants that we see and so the first type these are the ones that check off every single box they have everything but they're grades are not that great so we ask them what do 

you think happened here and they'll say I felt overwhelmed I was kind of spread thin and I didn't focus on the right things okay so we look at type two they have good grades actually they have the best grades top grades but that's all they really had right very one-dimensional so again you ask them what do you think happened and they would say I don't think I focused on the right things now the third group we call the balanced student they had good grades 

not the best they had a lot of extracurriculars not the best but they stood out in some way maybe they're really good at research maybe they're really good at clinical experience and it's no surprise that these are the ones that get into med school not the first two group and so you ask them what do you think went well and they would say I think I focused on the right things so time is not our most valuable resource it's Focus we all have the same am amount of time in the day but it depends on how 

you spend that time how you prioritize that so the way that we teach our students is this needs and duties framework this is how you prioritize your tasks so needs these are things that are non-negotiable you have to do it this is what keeps the lights on that keeps your life running Duties are non- urgent but this is this is where the magic happens right this is how you level up in life and then if you ever have to ask is this even worth doing then it's 

probably nonsense so this is the game right here duties is what levels you up so very basic example you have to eat sleep work pay the bills to stay alive but it's your duty to learn new skills it's your duty to make time for relationships make time for self-care and as a doctor I hate to say this but it's your duty to exercise if you don't do it today your life is not going to fall apart but you still got to do it everything else is nonsense so 

everyone in this room we all know what our needs and Duties are right it's not hard to figure out but are you focusing on them when it actually matters so for that we think to the 8020 rule youall familiar with this awesome 8% results come from 20% of your actions and so you apply it to this framework and it looks like this we spend most of our time keeping ourselves alive but 20% of our actions is on the duties that's what moves us 

forward so for students in this room you spend most of your time studying but it's your duty to work on your study skills to get better at learning right try not to worry too much about your grades for entrepreneurs in here working in the business is a need but working on the business is your duty to keep it growing and don't spend time griefing about the trolls and the hate comments right and then when it comes to making more money it's our need to go to work get a regular paycheck but it's our duty to 

work on ourselves and get the promotion right and this is my hot take I don't know if there's any Finance GS in the room here but I think it's uh nonsense to be wasting your time hacking credit card reward points probably better to spend time getting the promotion it's better for your long-term wealth but flying here we wish we had reward points to use so sad times yeah but that's it right there so needs duties non 

focus on this eliminate this and that is how priorization creates possibilities so we're gonna go ahead and switch over to a demo real quick all right so I want to show you guys how we do this in a notion ourself we're just going to be building off that same workflow I showed before with the three related databases and the cool thing about notion is we can create a separate dashboard here and all I've done is really just make a new linked view of our to-do database and it can pull in 

all the needs and all the duties we have as you can see here from any project that we have or even from our personal life which I don't have a project related to now we probably all know that we use our to-do list like this you can just kind of run through them and have this organization but where I think this system is really Shine for us is how it SS with notion calendar and there is a very slight Nuance that I like to do in notion calendar which I'll show has a technical step um but it's works really great for me and so if we go to our original data database here I've created 

two separate calendar views here one for my needs one for my duties and very simply all I did was just tag my needs and needs duties and duties because what that allows you to do is when you import those calendars into notion calendar you can actually pull in multiple calendars from the same database so I have my needs dat database and my duties but they come from the same one now the reason I do this is because from a bird's eyee view I want to see what color all my needs are and what color my Duties are so I don't have to like worry 

about oh all my my needs are always blue my duties are green and that also allows me using notion calendar that all of my meetings that get sked through Zoom or through my email they automatically populate in here already as well so I know which all my needs are and which ones are my duties needs can be easily scheduled into my calendar you guys don't really need to look too closely at what I'm doing all day but uh this is what it looks like for duties they're a bit more flexible and we actually have a very specific workflow that we go through um and Mike's going to walk through how that works so we can go 

back awesome so that's for last here is how to actually make progress towards your goals so when it comes to needs it's very easy to make progress right because if you don't do it then serious consequences happen don't show up to work you get fired don't study for exams then you can fail out of school but when it comes to duties it's much harder to make progress because there there are no immediate consequences if you don't don't do them you forget to eat healthy 

today it's okay just eat healthy tomorrow right forget to out this week then you can work out next week or next month so thinking about life in this way is not a good idea though because duties is what levels you up and if you're feeling stuck in life you can't keep neglecting your duties so this is how we teach how to make progress towards our duties every day three simple steps step one is to pick 

one duty and work on one each day just focus on one you don't want to spread yourself thin right so this is a snapshot of me when I was at the hospital uh my needs column I'd have to work sleep grocery shop prepare my meals study for my boards to maintain my license but in my duties column these are some things I could do I could further my credentials I could learn Spanish because most of my patients were Spanish speaking only I could attempt side hustling or I could work on 

networking right it's the reason why we're all here today and so I chose side hustling uh that was the YouTube channel and so when we look at my schedule here it's a little wonky sorry about that but basically my needs are all from 7:00 a.m. to 7: p.m. I couldn't really do anything about that non-negotiable but when I got home I had this little window where I could fit in my one duty for the day so I tried this and this is where 

another problem starts to arise and that takes us to step two so for step two we want to find a pocket of focus for our duty what I mean by this is the ultradian rhythms so as human beings what happens is we cycle in and out of more focus and less Focus happens every 90 minutes very similar to the Circadian rhythm if you're familiar with that every 90 minutes we go in and out of REM sleep and so when you're awake it's pretty much the same thing so you think about your day and you think about when 

do I actually have Peak Focus that I can work on my duty and if you don't have one like me if you think about my schedule here I thought that my pocket of focus was right there after work right but has anyone here tried doing lifechanging work after a long days of work it doesn't happen right I could have three hours here I could have 10 hours here that matter if all I want to do is sleep nothing's going to 

happen so I had to find a pocket and what I did something I resisted for a long time was I moved this here got to wake up a bit earlier yes but now I had energy now I was well rested and that's when my pocket of focus truly was for my life-changing work so if you don't have one you got to create one number three work uninterrupted for 60 to 90 minutes this is again the old trading rhythms every 990 minutes we cycle out so if you push Beyond 90 minutes that's when you 

get diminishing returns so not that great to push 5 6 hours straight it's more strategic to take breaks so that you can actually go for longer and this is how you work with your brain not against your brain so those are three steps do this for 30 days and I promise you will make progress towards your duties and of course we do this in notion here we are in notion again and I'm just going to speedrun through those three steps Mike just said um we can all 

keep up here I hope so first step is we just want to pick one duty we work on and we've already split up our needs and duties here so I'm just going to let's say I want to update my YouTube content strategy for October um I could just put the calendar date in and that automatically should update in notion calendar perfect so I know exactly what my duty is for the day personally I like to pick my duties the night before um this is because it helps me sleep better you can remove any of that anxiety of like what do I need to do tomorrow you know just get restful sleep and so when you wake up you know exactly what you 

need to do step two of the system is now we have to create a block of focus so again I love notion calendar for this because you can actually set up repeating events in your calendar so like I have here Monday through Friday my focus block because I have the freedom to work when I want to I decided that um it's in the morning from 7: to 11:00 a.m. and what I really love about nocean calendar and this comes to step number three is you can turn on this Auto decline meetings during this time so I really just have uninter rupted Focus for I guess for me it's 4 hours 

because I do two back toback sessions um that's all the time for my duties every single day then at 11:00 a.m. I'm like great all my hard work is done for the day all my life-changing work is done and I can just be on with it and uh make progress and how else I wanted to so that's our system in Ocean but I kind of lied to you guys because there's actually a fourth step in this process and we actually only discovered it after using this system for a few years because once you start to complete projects you start 

to develop a process for the way that you do things and that process being a notion you get to reuse the projects that you worked on but more importantly you get to share that process with other people and that's how you can use this system to help level up other people as well and if you own a business provide more value and even make some more money so let me show you guys a few examples of how we've used this in our business so when I was in medical school I had to study a lot obviously and I had a problem that it 

was really hard to manage all my studies I wanted more free time so I can build a business with Mike and so I created something called the study scheduler very Innovative name I know but it helped me save some time and it was great so we decided to share that process with our audience on YouTube that video blew up got almost two million views I think and that process has been used by over 300,000 students to this day that laid the foundation for one of our courses in our business another another example when we use this 

Mike and I we collaborate on notion and a lot of our content is educational so we do a lot of reading we do a lot of researching a lot of learning so we needed a place to collaborate on those ideas together we also needed to manage our projects manage our team members manage our editors and stuff and so I built a process which I called the extended brain again we shared that with our YouTube audience that video also almost got 2 million views and it laid the foundation for an adjacent course that we created called extended brain which has now been used by over a thousand creators to help them do the same thing both those things just start 

off as me solving my own problems I was just solving my own problems and I think that's really like the power of the Creator economy here we can help other people beat the levels and get to where we were and we all win right and so I think there's always an element of luck to video games but I think that we also have the ability to create our own luck by sharing our process with other people we want anyone to be able to click on our character profile right and see what what kind of levels have I beaten what projects have I solved and then is this 

person the one who can help me get there because we're all creators here at notion you like to make stuff and I think that sure leveling up yourself is cool but where it becomes really meaningful is when you help other people level up as well and so if you guys want to play this multiplayer game with us we'd love to support you on your quests I'm going to drop a QR code here you guys can grab our process it's called the focus log it just has the exact system we just just talked about here completely free just want to help you 

guys out um and if anyone's interested we also work directly with creators to help them build an online education business as well and so I want to leave you guys with one final quote which I either found somewhere or I made up I forget um you don't find a meaningful life you can only create one and with tools like notion we can build the future and we can leave a path for everyone else to follow us so thank you guys so much for your attention for your time thanks for laughing at her jokes uh 

it's been fun
