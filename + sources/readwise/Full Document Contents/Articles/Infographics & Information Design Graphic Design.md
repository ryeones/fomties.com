pictures into almost taking it back to like an elementary approach where it's like okay we have all this data how can we best show it so that people understand it digest it and share it a couple really really good sites to look at is good that is they feature different beautiful infographics from different people and agencies from again around the world and it can range from anything like some of them are unleash 

your inner creativity or internet social media business drivers so a lot of businesses actually use infographics to show why you should use their business I know one of them Rackspace which is a hosting site use an infographic that showed how much data is being stored in the world and why you should choose them another thing to look at too is a website called visually and you can actually create infographics from them or explore other infographics and also buy like templates for for making 

infographic design and then column five is a really good agency that is like the leader and not only regular infographics but also interactive infographics so you may go to a graphic and then see that you can click on it and then clicking on it you'll like see more information as well infographic design is not only just about the design but also having a passion for data so a lot of the times you may get a brief that has a whole bunch of data that you have to break 

down into like visual components and sometimes you won't sometimes you actually have to break down the data yourself and determine okay which data is most important to show through through here like through icons and you also want to make it simple it's almost like a logo where where you want to make sure that you're not overusing the same icons over again or using like complicated graphics in which it almost looks like a photo rather than an actual infographic so infographics is I mean there's no right 

or wrong way but it definitely is like a really it's a really awesome field of design to to explore not only for its potential to help people learn but also for its potential to help you advertise for your business you know the first things that we learn even as a kid is to recognize the stop sign and Rexach will recognize the shape it's a hexagon or recognize you know like that like the 

bathroom like male/female like so euro you're taught already to recognize shapes and to process it in a way where it's like if these shapes are over here then it means this and if these shapes are over here and these colors are being used and it means that so infographics has a way of literally breaking down like what would be 50 pages of information and two key points and being just enough for you to either explore more or have enough like working 

knowledge to get to get what you need out of it
