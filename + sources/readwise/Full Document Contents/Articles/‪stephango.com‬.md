- Summary: The "File over app" philosophy emphasizes creating digital files that you can control and easily access. Unlike apps, which may become obsolete, the files you create should be durable and retrievable for the future. It's important to own your data and ensure it can be read across different systems and generations.

File over app · 2023 [stephango.com/file-over-app](https://stephango.com/file-over-app)

![File over app is a philosophy: if you want to create digital artifacts that last, they must be files you can control, in formats that are easy to retrieve and read. Use tools that give you this freedom.

File over app is an appeal to tool makers: accept that all software is ephemeral, and give people ownership over their data.

In the fullness of time, the files you create are more important than the tools you use to create them. Apps are ephemeral, but your files have a chance to last.

The ancient temples of Egypt contain hieroglyphs that were chiseled in stone thousands of years ago. The ideas hieroglyphs convey are more important than the type of chisel that was used to carve them.

The world is filled with ideas from generations past, transmitted through many mediums, from clay tablets to manuscripts, paintings, sculptures, and tapestries. These artifacts are objects that you can touch, hold, own, store, preserve, and look at. To read something written on paper all you need is eyeballs.](https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:4pklmqyj4mew3wftz7edg4fy/bafkreieecgaj4j7ewplqg6mtkukntia7h3qa7cmbknpqoya62hnwjad3gu@jpeg)

![Today, we are creating innumerable digital artifacts, but most of these artifacts are out of our control. They are stored on servers, in databases, gated behind an internet connection, and login to a cloud service. Even the files on your hard drive use proprietary formats that make them incompatible with older systems and other tools.

Paraphrasing something I wrote recently:

"If you want your writing to still be readable on a computer from the 2060s or 2160s, it’s important that your notes can be read on a computer from the 1960s."

You should want the files you create to be durable, not only for posterity, but also for your future self. You never know when you might want to go back to something you created years or decades ago. Don’t lock your data into a format you can’t retrieve.

These days I write using an app I help make called Obsidian, but it’s a delusion to think it will last forever. The app will eventually become obsolete. It’s the plain text files I create that are designed to last. Who knows if anyone will want to read them besides me, but future me is enough of an audience to make it worthwhile.](https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:4pklmqyj4mew3wftz7edg4fy/bafkreiay6y4jpt2ay6gmeg5pcdjfa2ekljphwwd4egf3hgm6rekjwv5xzq@jpeg)

In the same vein, "protocol over app" is something I'm starting to value much more.

Been thinking lately on writing a web browser with a file-over-app mindset. Long ago, maybe in the 90s, an HTML file, image files, js, and css files could reliably reproduce a web page as you saw it… Would be great if “save web page” was a real and simple thing for saving an article or blog post.

lowkey this has motivated me to start a whole website/product. Will reply to this once it's live.

it’s tough, but agree with you on the most part. only thing is sometimes you just do require the functions of certain apps (notion gallery view for files in jpgs/gifs), which is really tough to replicate with dataview in obsidian, since they only consider md files, at least to my knowledge.
