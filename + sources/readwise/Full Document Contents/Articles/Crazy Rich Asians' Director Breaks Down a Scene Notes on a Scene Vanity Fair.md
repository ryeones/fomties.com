## Full Document
hey what's going on I'm Jon M Chu and this is notes on a scene for my new film crazy rich Asians I think I'm just wanted enough with you all I reckon making this movie meant so much to me as a filmmaker to go deal with the most personal thing in my life which is my cultural identity to do it on this scale with an all-asian cast for the first time in years and the first time in a Hollywood movie to have a romantic contemporary Asian American couple means a lot to me and to see the community 

come out and root for this movie and I think we have a great movie to root for has changed my whole life all right so this scene is where Rachel she's pulling up to her boyfriend's house which she's never been to what she doesn't know it she's come from the richest family in Singapore so this is her first glimpse of his world [Music] our movie takes place in Singapore we 

shot both in Malaysia and Singapore for this particular scene a couple things here right away this blonde wig awkwafina does not have this hair originally a pic Lin was supposed to be a character that changes looks every time she's in a scene we're supposed to have all these different looks but when she put on this blonde wig she looked so amazing that she turned into the character that we kept it she also is so into character that she's not really looking like she's driving so we had to continue to remind her drive the car because this is all green-screen back here and we have lights flashing a set 

to look like they're actually driving and if you look at her wardrobe here she has these dogs on this pajama outfit which is actually super super expensive actually so don't be fooled by pajamas alright so here they are driving up to tire cell park oh my god beautiful 200 Miller the real-estate spectacular [Music] in Singapore there's not a lot of room so to have this much space means they 

have a lot of money the shot in particular is almost all CG we needed a big entrance almost a Gatsby entrance to this place and all of this water is all fake this is all fake we created a little dock here this little bridge this house we built in the space but this is actually just using photographs to make it a Singapore will be put in the background because this is actually in Malaysia and and then as we keep going you'll see here so all these cars are CG 

all these people are I mean everything 100% alright so we're pulling up to tyre cell park this is actually in Malaysia we shot for about forty three forty four days on this movie but in this property itself it was probably three days and it rains every day for hours and so you have to shoot then let it rain and then go back to shooting but here we added these little piranha canned touches to 

make the building look more like Kevin Kwan who's the writer his house when he was growing up so all these little details were new this whole thing in out here was just empty space so we we added all the vegetation and flowered who really wanted this tropical deco feel in Singapore it has that humidity in the middle of the night it's 90 something degrees it's potent you can feel it originally these lanterns were white and michelle yeoh came on the set she's like 

you cannot have white lanterns because they mean death that they they're like in a funeral so we had to nix that and make them red if I had a red pin I would do that so those are all gelled and this house was actually abandoned so it has a lot of like monkey poo everywhere I don't know if how to draw a monkey but monkey poo everywhere and bats that flew everywhere so we had to we cleared it out made it really clean made it really 

beautiful so that audiences would not know that it was a dump alright so they're pulling up to tarsal Park and this is where our Nick young are Asian male romantic lead comes out this moment was very important to me to make sure that we highlight him and how dapper he is we've sort of known him as the dude from New York so to see this from go from the adventure to the aristocrat was really important for me in this suit we did many different versions of this suit that double-breasted though all these different colors but the white one 

looked the best on him and Henry Golding he actually has never acted before and he this is his first movie and I found him through our accountant Lisa Kim our accountant in Malaysia saw him and so I then Instagram stalked him and found a mutual friend named Steve Jiang Steve janken a on Facebook and this is me over here and that's how we found this guy and made 

him the cover of every book and poster around town [Music] my players and bachelor we really wanted Rachel Chu an asian-american coming to Asia for the first time her point of view of course Henry Goulding his voice is just killer it's like butter I think I'm just wanting love with you am I ever again this line was not scripted he said that just randomly on the day I thought it 

was a little cheesy but he delivers it's so well we knew we wanted to show off her dress we hadn't seen what dress she was wearing so this serve both purposes of seeing how she dressed for the party and having a great moment for their kiss this is actually a grass this grass bout here is as taupe should be totally empty we built this giant building behind them this is where we're gonna have the flower later blossom in the movie that you'll see so literally we built this whole place we actually had tropical birds everywhere but the birds were so loud that we just mixed them so they're 

somewhere in a cage somewhere hanging out those birds and this this car here we it was sort of a normal color so we wrapped it in this sort of matte pink color so they kiss a nice little push in huh and a clan is still there right job this is my friend Pigman Aquafina would riff all the time in these scenes she was so funny we had to cut out most of her lines because they were so dirty 

thank you very much for ranger oh no worries join us stop after some dinner oh no I couldn't impose you know I had some dinner so Aquafina is hilarious and one of my favorite gags that she does is this walk she literally does this funny walk in these giant heels in this elegant beautiful place and then this whole joke all of these things actually on the day this is like 4:00 in the morning shooting this and every label you 

couldn't read so we these are all actually cg labels if you can believe it or not alright so this shot is the last shot of the night they were kicking us off of the property and I did not have this shot of her I did not have her response and it's a great line a cocktail dress in your trunk I'm not an animal Rachel we had cut it and then everyone loved it so much we put it back in so awkwafina's delivery of I'm not an animal not in animal rachel was really important and we didn't have the shot so 

my producer is literally yelling at me I was like fine then we're not gonna have to say we're gonna have to come back and do this the next day there's no time left tonight so you better be ready to spend more money tomorrow he went silent and then we just shot what I think we did this one take twice in a row and Aquafina always kills it always kills it there's that the muscle sign always kills it and yeah that's uh that's how we got crazy rich Asians
