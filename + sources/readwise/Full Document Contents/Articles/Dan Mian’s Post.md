Helping UK-based graduates land top jobs | Founder @Gradvance | 300+ Success Stories | Onboarding our January 2025 cohort now - DM me ‚ÄúDREAM JOB‚Äù to learn more üöÄ

I‚Äôll never forget when someone took a chance on me.

I didn‚Äôt have the perfect CV, years of experience or all the skills.

But they saw my potential.  

And I went on to become one of their best hires.

People with the right attitude, mindset & work ethic will outperform those who tick every box on paper.

Leaders, take a chance:

‚û° Hire the person who‚Äôs eager to learn.  

‚û° Give the junior team member a seat at the table.  

‚û° Give the project to someone who‚Äôs never done it before.  

‚û° Support the career changer who brings a new perspective.

Job seekers, here are 3 ways to show your potential:

1. Share Your Story  

‚Ü≥ Use interviews to tell your story and use a range of experiences.  

‚Ü≥ Use LinkedIn About section and write content to amplify.

2. Show Motivation  

‚Ü≥ Employers love when people have strong reasons to work for them.  

‚Ü≥ Research the industry, role, company, products/services & customers.

3. Highlight Achievements  

‚Ü≥ Impact is impact, no matter what industry you're in.  

‚Ü≥ Show you're an over-achiever using real examples & results.

Be the leader who looks beyond the CV.

When you take a chance on someone:  

- You build their confidence.  

- You inspire their growth.

And they‚Äôll give everything to prove you right!

We need to look beyond the CV when hiring.
