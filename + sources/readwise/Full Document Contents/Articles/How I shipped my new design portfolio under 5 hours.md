## Full Document
### What to improve?

This is the second iteration of my Notion portfolio and there are 3 challenges I am looking to tackle:

* Provide a clear definition of who I am and what I have to offer from the start
* Demonstrate a wide range of skills and offerings without overwhelming my audience
* Encourage exploration while keep it simple

ðŸ‘‡ Letâ€™s get to the details.

### The first screen

For the first screen, I want to achieve two goals: **introduce myself** and **offer ways for people to find me**. My unique challenge is the variety in my offerings.

The first screenMy first assumption is that 

**audience of my portfolio are interested in different aspects of me**. For example, people who followed me from 

[Unsplash](https://archive.ph/o/RpxXN/https://unsplash.com/@lennonzf) or 

[Instagram](https://archive.ph/o/RpxXN/https://www.instagram.com/lennonzf/) are not necessarily interested in my design skills to start with.

So, why not allowing them to explore the part they want?

I set up 4 in-page links in the intro copy to encourage people exploring the aspects they are interested about me.

The second assumption is that **people want to quickly find me** on the other corners of the Internet or contact me. Hence, a find me section with links.

### My experience

The immediate section following is the typical experience column in my CV with a structure to help digest the information a bit easier:

* **Current** â€” Where am I? What I am doing now?
* **Previous**â€”Where was I before?
* **Outside 9 to 5**â€”What are the activities I do out of interest and outside of work?

My experience### My core skills and offering

Next up is the section for my core skills and offeringâ€”Interaction and experience design. While being parallel to the rest of 3 offerings: illustrations, mobile photography and Notion, this section will be the main reason why people landed on my portfolio.

The goal for this section is to **demonstrate my broad range of design skills** (including coding)and **examples of work** in the simplest and quickest way.

My core skills and offeringMy approach is simple:

* **List out my capabilities**â€”A clear statement with links to my work snapshots and a list of clients I have worked with
* **Show the current project I am working on**â€”A project statement with work-in-progress shots and extra outputs (e.g. A link to my article in Medium)

#### An alternative to case study: snapshots of my work

I will admit it. Working as an agency designer, I donâ€™t have time, nor do I have much motivation to write case studies. Yet, I would still like a place to explain the complexity and diversity in my work and outputs.

What if I just show snippets of my work and organise them into a glossary type of page? Here it is.
