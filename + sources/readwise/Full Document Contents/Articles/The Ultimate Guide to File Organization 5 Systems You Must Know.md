## Full Document
Are you feeling overwhelmed by yourdigital files?Ever find yourself scrolling throughendless folders looking for that oneelusive document?I used to have that problem all the time.But every time this happens to me, I liketo do an after-action review and askmyself,"How in the end did I find that file?"And tweak my system to improve findability.

My files were a mishmash of random namesand disorganized folders, and I wastedhours trying to find what I need.Over the years, I discovered these fivepowerful systems for organizing my filesinto folders: para access, Johnny Decimal,Zettelkasten, and GTD.

I picked up a few ideas from each.Whether you’re using Obsidian, Evernote,OneNote, Notion, Chrome, or any otherknowledge management tool, these systemswill revolutionize the way you workwith files.

They will help you find what you need,avoid duplication and clutter, and makesense of your digital information.So in this video, I’m going to walk youthrough each system, explain how theywork, and help you decide which one isThe right system for you.

But first, let me ask you this:How do you rate, on a scale from 1 to 10,your current file organization?Do you have a system, or do you just wingit?Share your thoughts in the commentsbelow.

Before we dive into today's topic, let'stake a quick trip down memory lane.A few months ago, I made a video abouthow to organize your notes usingdifferent PKM approaches.In that video, we explored a range ofdifferent strategies, from random Massthrough the daily notes first, andcontent first approaches, then the topicfirst approach, including zatocastan, andfinally the action first method.

If you missed that video, I highlyrecommend checking it out afterward; itwill give you a solid foundation forunderstanding how to structure yournotes and information.

Today, we're going to shift our focus toorganizing files into folders, and I'llintroduce you to five powerful systemsthat will revolutionize the way youmanage your files.But don't worry if you haven't seen theIn the previous video, you're still going to beable to follow along and learn a lot,so let's jump in and explore these fivesystems in more detail.

Before we dive into the five systems fororganizing your files, let's talk aboutwhat makes a good folder structure.

A good folder structure should reflectthe way you work and make it easy tofind and access the files you need.That’s why understanding differentorganizational systems is so important.

There are several approaches toorganizing files, and each has its ownstrengths and weaknesses. Nick Milo'saccess system, for example, is designed tobalance the needs of knowledgemanagement and action using both linksand folders.

Thiago Fortes' PARA method, on the otherhand, is folder-based and action-oriented,helping you prioritize and manageprojects effectively.David Allen's GTD system is similar toPARA, with a focus on organizingreference information in a filingcabinet and tracking action through theuse of lists.

Johnny Decimal is also strongly folderbased, but it’s more geared towardsCreating a reference archive is better than aworkflow system, and finally, Zettelcustom is a link-based system thatemphasizes Knowledge Management andexploration.

Now let's explore each of these systemsin more detail.

We'll start with the Pair method, whichis a great way to get started withorganizing your files. If your primaryaim is to get things delivered,the method is a highly effective system fororganizing digital files. In fact, he usesthe metaphor of cooking to explain thefour key areas of his system.

The first area is projects, which arelike dishes cooking on the stove thatrequire your immediate attention. Thesecond area is areas, which are likeitems stored in your fridge that youaccess regularly but are not currentlyworking on.

These areas are usually long-termcommitments, such as finances, home, andfamily. The third area is resources, which arelike items stored in your freezer forfuture use.Files in this area include topics thatinterest you or research materials.

Finally, the fourth area is our hives,which are like items stored in yourpantrythat you have completed or put on hold.Then, organize new information usingthe PARA method.Thiago recommends asking three questionsto help determine the best place tostore the file.

The first question is:In which project will this be mostuseful? If there is a relevant activeproject,store the file there.

If not project related, the secondquestion to ask is:In which area will this be most useful?If there's an area, store the file there.If the file doesn't belong to anyspecific project or area, the thirdquestion to ask is: which resource doesthis belong to?Store it with the relevant resource orplace it in the archives.

To give you an idea of how a pair offolder structures look like, here's aquick example.If you'd like to learn more, I cover PARAin my book on a page review of Thiago'sBuilding a Second Brain book.

See the link in the video description.Moving on to the Johnny Decimal System, asimple and effective method fororganizing your digital files based on anumbering schemecreated by John Noble, the Johnny DecimalSystem consists of three easy-to-followsteps that will help you create aconsistent and logical file structurethat makes it easy to find and accessyour files.

Step one involves dividing everythingyou want to organize into a maximum of 10broad and high-level areas, assigningeach area a number from 10 to 90.

Step 2 is about dividing each area intoa maximum of 10 more specific and granularcategories, assigning each category anumber from 0 to 9. And finally, step 3involves naming your files with adescriptive title and adding thecorresponding area plus category numbersfollowed by a DOT and a sequential IDnumber at the beginning or the end ofthe file name.

By limiting the number of areas andcategories, the Johnny Decimal Systemhelps you avoid overcrowding folders ormisplacing files,and to stay on top of the ID numbers.

Johnny recommends creating a separateindex file to track them, and thebenefits of the Johnny Decimal Systemdon't stop here. You can also referencethe category ID number in the subject ofan email to include it in your archivingsystem and easily locate all elementswithin a category in all your digitalfiles.

In tools like Obsidian, Loxic, Rome,and others, you can use document metadatato add the reference number or createfolders in the Obsidian file explorerusing the Johnny Decimal System.

If you're working in a multi-projectenvironment, Johnny suggests extendingthe system with another layer: theproject layer. Simply list folders forprojects at the root of your file systemwith three-digit ID numbers, and thenfollow the area category file approachdiscussed earlier within each folder.

Check out the link in the videodescription to learn more about theJohnny Decimal System and startorganizing your digital files like a pro.This is an innovative framework fororganizing your information created byNick Milo. ACCESS stands for Atlas,Calendar, Cards, Extras, Sources, and Spaces.

These six plus one folders are arrangedto maximize productivity and clarity. Theseventh folder, Encounters, is introducedin the layout of six and is designed tocapture unsorted items. Because of theseventh folder, I’d argue that accessshould be really renamed to e-axis.

Now let’s dive into the six main folders.Atlas is where you’ll find high-levelnodes, including maps of content,dashboards, and overviews. These areindispensable for navigating andorienting yourself in your personalknowledge management system.

Calendar is dedicated to logging,tracking, and reviewing time-basedinformation. This encompasses your dailynotes, meeting notes, plans, reviews, andjournals.

Cards is where you can build and connectideas and insights. This is the place tostore your notes about concepts, people,and things.

Extras houses all your support materials,such as images, manuals, and templates.It’s also the perfect spot for thosemiscellaneous files that don’t quite fitinto any of the other categories.

Sources is where you’ll store all yourexternal sources of knowledge, such asArticles, books, podcasts, and videos — thisis the ideal location to reference orcite your original sources ofinformation or inspiration.

Finally, spaces represent the differentareas of your life, such as work, personallife, and hobbies. Each space has its ownmaps of content areas, projects, andsupport notes — or in short, maps providingadditional structure and clarity.

The access folder structure is designedto help manage both knowledge and action,with knowledge at the top and action atthe bottom. This approach ensures thatyour files are assigned a clear functionand purpose, making it easy to avoidoverlapping or misplacing files.

The flat file structure is a filestorage approach where all files andfolders are stored at the same level,without any subfolders. This systemplaces more emphasis on file naming andlinking rather than organizing filesinto complex folder hierarchies.

Examples of systems that use a flat filestructure are the Brain, Roam, and Loxoc.While Loxoc and Roam offernamespaces, the Brain can displayyour computer's folder tree on itsblacks. None of them have a native folder.

Setup: one of the main advantages of using aflat file structure is that it reducesthe time spent creating and managingfolder structures, and it makes it easierto find and link related files.However, this does not mean that youcannot use folders at all in a flat filestructure. You can still have folders, butthey will be located at the top level ofyour directory.

When using a flat file structure, it iscrucial to pay attention to the filenaming conventions and use clear anddistinctive naming.For instance, starting files with thedate in a year, month, day format can behelpful.Maps of content files can also play animportant role in a flat file structure.

David Allen, in "Getting Things Done,"recommends filing physical referencedocuments in cabinets.He offers a simple alphabetical approachin which each document gets stored in aphysical folder with a label on thefolder identifying the topic.Folders are stored in alphabetical order.

In a digital system, Zettelkasten nodesmight include attachments such as images.

To manage attachments, tools like thefolder node plugin in Obsidian can besuper useful.Similarly, the brain also automaticallycreates a folder for each thought; theirthought-related attachments can bestored.If you're interested in learning more aboutZettelkasten, I have several videos onthe subject, including my book on a pagesummary of "How to Take Smart Notes" bySönke Ahrens; you'll find references inthe video description below.

To wrap up, I shared with you some of themost popular systems for organizing yourfiles into folders, including PARA byThiago Forte, the Johnny Decimal System,and ACCESS by Nick Milo.These approaches offer different toolsfor managing knowledge and actions,as well as linking versus organizing files andfolders.

While I will delve into the specifics ofmy own folder structure in a futurevideo, I wanted to share with you some ofmy reflections on the approachespresented today and how I am applyingthese in my own system. I like referenceNumbers in the Johnny Decimal Systemoffer cross-platformconnections such as BitV, my files,my PKM, and my emails.

I've always been a folders guy; however,the more I think about flat structures,the more I like them.They place more focus on linking,which I think is important.Zato is a great way to avoid orphannotes in your PKM because each new itemmust be placed somewhere in an existingchain.An inbox is a crucial part of a PKMsystem. I like the encounters folder inNix access system and the inbox in GTD.

I find that thinking about a file pathas a namespace that provides a primaryontology for a file and not as a storagelocation is helpful.I find it very valuable to have foldersfor note attachments, like in the brain.I'm currently exploring Aiden Alex'sfolder node plugin for this purpose.My current idea is to use folder notesas my maps of content for each folder inmy system.

Reflecting on Pera,I don't like to move files around, suchas copying files to a project folder, andThen to another location after theproject is completed, I would much ratherorganize using metadata.

It is also true that my dislike formoving files is partly driven by thelimitations of Obsidian sync settings.My PKM and my PC hold many generationsof nodes. I call this a Brownfield.Reality versus the Green Field ofbuilding something completely new.Because I work in a Brownfieldenvironment, this limits my freedom inapplying new approaches.Finally, organizing notes is about somuch more than just folders and filenames.It also includes the use of tags, links,templates, ontology maps of content,dynamic lists, geotags, daily notes, andmuch more.I hope you found this video helpful, andI look forward to sharing more about myown approach in the future.If you liked this video, please considersubscribing to my channel, sharing yourthoughts in the comments below, and hitthat like button.Thank you!
