I write a monthly newsletter, and I thinkthat you should too. I've got fivereasons why I started my newsletter, andby the end of this video, I think youmight feel inspired to start your ownemail newsletter as well. And if you are,you can check out my follow-up video tothis, where I show exactly how I do itusing Things and Obsidian, and I'll sharemy entire process. But for now, I want totalk a little bit about why I write anewsletter. I'm coming up on the 4-yearanniversary of the Dan Chronicles. Youcan see I'm wearing a shirt right now,the Dan Chronicles newsletter, and Iwanted to talk a little bit about why Ias just a regular person decided tostart an email newsletter and why Ithink that you should start one as well.I also just want to say that this videois not me trying to get you to sign upfor my newsletter. I don't actually careI don't make any money off of it. If youfind it interesting, feel free to sign up,and if not, don't. It's no skin off myback. In a few moments, you'll see exactlywhy I started it, and it's not just toget more followers. So, the Dan Chroniclesis an email newsletter with a specificformat.

I casually talk about whatever is on mymind, and then there are five differentsections where in each section I talkabout something that caught my eye inthe past month. That's it. I see myself asa curator more than anything, and thefact of going through and deciding whatto include in my newsletter makes memore thoughtful about the content thatI'm consuming and thinking about why Iactually find it interesting and useful.It makes me actually process thosethoughts. That alone I think is a greatreason to start a newsletter.

I took inspiration for my newsletter from threedifferent email newsletters. The firstone is the old Nat Eliason Monday Medley.Before he got into crypto, he had aweekly Monday email that was verysimilar in format to what I have, where heshared some things that caught hisattention in the past week. You mayremember Nat Eliason; he had a reallypopular post about Rome, which is anothernote-taking system that I think a lot ofpeople used before they got intoObsidian, myself included. He was amajor reason why I discovered the wholePKM (Personal Knowledge Management)Obsidian world.

The newsletter is Kevin Rose's old emailnewsletter. Also, before he got intocrypto, Kevin Rose was the founder of Dig,which is a competitor to Reddit. Heused to have a monthly newsletter wherehe would share some interesting things,and I always found it super interestingto kind of see what caughthis attention. I really enjoyedgetting that every month before hestopped. The final newsletter isstill active; it's called Next Draft. It'sby Dave Pell, and it's a daily newsletterwhere he is kind of the curator, theeditor of the internet, where he collectsthe best writing every single day.It's a wonderful newsletter, but it'salso just a lot of content. It can be toomuch to get through, and I don’t findmyself reading it every day. However,every so often I’ll jump into it. But either way,it’s definitely a big inspiration for me.If you’re starting your own newsletter, Iencourage you to take a look at otherpeople’s content that you like and pickout the things that you like. Usetheir level of quality as the bar thatyou set for yourself for your ownnewsletter, because that will allow youto shortcut to success in terms of whatYou’re going to be creating and doingall right. With that intro, let’s jumpinto the five reasons why I started anewsletter and why I think you should aswell. It’s a great way to stay in touchwith people. I’ve historically beenreally bad at keeping in contact withpeople, and I see my newsletter as a formof leverage for maintaining contact witha large number of people. I definitelyconsider myself an introvert, and anewsletter is the perfect way tomaintain social contact with people. Foran introvert, I have a lot of personalfriends and family who subscribe to thenewsletter, and it’s always great to seesomebody in person and have something totalk about. They’ll bring up somethingthat they read in the newsletter, andit’s a great way to kind of spark thatconversation and find a sharedinterest. It shows where our interestsare similar and also allows them tofind things that they might findinteresting but don’t know much about, sothey can ask me about it. Because often,if I’m sharing something in thenewsletter, it’s something that I know alittle bit about. An email newsletterdoes not replace actually working atFriendships and building a network can be a great tool to add to yourtool belt for doing all of that. It's away to process your thoughts. I'vementioned before that writing isthinking. Formulating your newslettermakes you think about why you find atopic interesting and actually helps youthink about how to communicate that toother people. Writing helps you identifyyour gaps in understanding of a specifictopic. I'll be surprised about writingon a topic that I feel like I knowreally well, and I end up doing a lot ofsearching and trying to find additionalinformation that I didn’t realize weregaps in my knowledge. Writing anewsletter is a way to flex yourthinking muscle, and who doesn’tlike to exercise their brain? There arelove letters to your future self. Anewsletter is a great way to stay intouch with other people, but each issueis actually a gift to your future self.

It's a snapshot of what you're thinkingabout at any given time, and it’s a joyto go back and review at a future date.Sometimes, I want to go back and see whenI was first thinking about a topic andwhat I was thinking about it.

Times I'm just feeling nostalgic, and Iwant to take a stroll down memory lane.Giving gifts like this to my future selfis a big motivator for me for writing,for taking pictures, for taking videos,because I feel like it's a way tocapture the moment for whatever ismeaningful to me at the time, and save it.It captures it for my future self.It helps people see new elements of yourpersonality. We collect friends,acquaintances, colleagues from differentparts of our lives, and we choose whataspects of our personality to share withthose people depending on the context ofthat relationship. Your work friends aregoing to see a different part of youthan your social friends. A newsletter isa way to share more sides of yourselfwith a wider audience. I've had a fewcolleagues describe an Aha moment wherethey realized that we had sharedinterests that they didn't realize.Acquaintances will sometimes realizethat we had more in common than theythought. Even when people don't readevery word of a newsletter—and I reallydon't expect them to, the mere fact thatit exists hints at a richer inner lifethan I think most people think about.

When they meet new people, it helpsbalance out your input-output ratio. Ithink a lot about my input-output ratio.I don’t want to be just a mindlessconsumer watching TV or movies andreading articles, books, and playing videogames; all that sort of stuff withoutputting anything out into the world ordoing anything with that stuff that I’mconsuming. I think it’s really easy tojust be a consumer, but I just don’tfeel right about that. Personally, for me,I just feel imbalanced doing somethingwith that input, such as writing anewsletter or writing a blog or makingvideos on YouTube. These are greatways to kind of work on that ratio andmake it more balanced. It allows you tojoin the conversation, participate inwhat’s happening, and just generally feelbetter about all the things that you’reconsuming and learning. If your input-output ratio is currently really off,balance with input, I highly encourageyou to just spend some time working onthat ratio, and I think that you’llreally start feeling better aboutyourself. You’ll be surprised at how muchof an impact that it has. And that’s it.In the next video, I’ll share exactly howI make my newsletter. I do it with theto-do app, Things, and Obsidian, and I sendthe email in Substack. I'll show youexactly my process for doing that, one thatI've honed over the past threeplusyears. You may like the same tool stackfor yourself. You might want to change ita little bit, but I'll show you how I'vebeen doing it. And again, if you've likedthis video, give it a thumbs up, subscribeto my channel, and subscribe to my newsletterif it sounds interesting, and I'll seeyou in the nextvideo.
