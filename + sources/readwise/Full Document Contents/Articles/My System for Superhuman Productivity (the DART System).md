## Full Document
the fact that you're not Eventing down says everything God he's been talking for over an hour now I know I should be taking notes but there's just too much information what was that date that he mentioned I already forgot it he's talking at a million words per hour sounded important I should be taking notes even if I was taking notes where would I put them though my journal my laptop Google Docs how would I even organize them what about all the stuff that I have to get done do I use the reminders app or should I just write them down on paper is that too 

oldfashioned even if I did figure this stuff out how would they all work together this is just too stressful I wish there was an easier way spoiler alert there is an easier way if you're anything like me then you've probably experienced the existential overwhelm that comes with finding a productivity system that works for you I mean seriously every time I think about how many productivity apps there are I get viciously nauseous I think I'm going to throw up that's why I've come up with a system that I'm so excited to share with with you today it takes all of the 

thinking out of events tasks notetaking and the best part is it all works together if you're new here then hello my name is Sean I am obsessed with finding the easy ways to optimize your day so that you can live a happier and healthier life and if you're old here thanks for coming back I guess hello good to see you too in this video I'm excited to be teaching you the exact same system that I've been using for the last 6 months to unlock what I can only describe as a superhuman level of productivity and I'm also going to be talking about the importance of having a system for getting things done so 

without further Ado let me be the first person to welcome you to and congratulate you on finding the dart system let's get into [Music] it okay before we get into the dart system itself I wanted to take just a quick moment to explore the importance of systems in general picture this it's 2003 in Great Britain where British cycling had been stagnant for decades only winning One Medal since 1908 entered Dave brailford the new performance director who was t tked with 

Reviving the team now fast forward to the 2008 Beijing Olympics British cycling snatched 60% of the gold medals from 2007 to 2017 they bagged 77 Olympic Golds 200 World Championships and five tour to France wins how was this all possible how did Great Britain Go from the worst cycling team in the world to one of the best in just 5 years it wasn't just ambitious goals but a systematic approach to incremental improvements Great Britain's story of success wasn't just about the goals it was about the systems that used to 

achieve those goals what separates winners and losers isn't the goal every cycling team has the same goal and it's usually to win as many competitions as possible what made the British cycling team different was the systems that they had in place to make small incremental changes over time so how do you unlock superhuman levels of productivity well it's simple just join a cycling team thanks so much for watching I hope this video helped and remember keep scrolling mindfully okay I'm just kidding that's obviously not the answer without that 

system of continuous small improvements it's probably pretty unlikely that Great Britain would have the Legacy that they do today in the same way without a foundational system of rules methods and organization it becomes increasingly difficult to make any sort of tangible progress towards your own productivity goals okay now that we have that out of the way let me explain the dart system the system is an acronym that creates an organizational framework for dates that you need to keep track of action items or tasks recordkeeping which are your notes and the way you access all three 

of those things with the least amount of Taps on your phone what makes me so excited about this system is that I found just four apps that work together seamlessly to create a bulletproof system of productivity that can handle anything anyone throws at it and made immediately usable and frictionless with this one little tweak but before we get to that let's get to the first app on our [Music] list as I work through the vapid and soul sucking experience that is your mid-20s I'm beginning to realize more 

and more one thing and what I'm about to say is the most Millennial bordering on gen Z like thing I could possibly say but laying out your life days weeks and even months in advance is the only way that you can feasibly stay on top of the things that you need to the places that you need to be and following through with the commitments that you've made and if you haven't picked up on it yet the first app in the dart system is a calendar now I could spend 3 to five business days going over seven different calendar apps that are all different in their own little quirky ways but it's pretty likely that you already have the perfect calendar app installed on your 

phone right now how do I know that well it's because the perfect calendar app is the one that you have on you at all times and for me that's Apple calendar I use Apple calendar for a couple reasons first and foremost it does exactly what I needed to do it allows me to keep track of key dates and events that I don't want to forget secondly it syncs really nicely and natively with the rest of the Apple devices that I have because Apple has me in an absolute choke hold and the last reason that I use Apple calendar is that it syncs really nicely with the next app in the dart system which we'll get to in just a second okay before we move on I want to make a quick 

note on something that'll help you integrate the dart system more seamlessly and instantly into your own life a shiny new camera doesn't make you a better photographer a special paintbrush doesn't make you a better artist and a fancy calendar app with more bells and whistles than an antique shop in the ' 80s is not going to make you a more productive person what I'm saying is this it's not about the app itself it's about how you use the app and that goes for the rest of the apps in the system for me what helped the most was just using the apps that I already had and actually figuring out to use them in a way that works for my own 

personal use you don't have to use the exact same apps that I'm about to show you in this video to build your own dart system in fact I don't want you to however you do have to at least try to remain consistent with the system in order for it to actually work choose an app that you actually like and that you'll actually use in each category of the dart system and customize it as you continue to use it that will be a necessary task that you should accomplish right now if you want the dart system to actually work for you speaking of tasks [Music] 

okay despite the word actionables not being recognized by most word processors now for some reason what the hell is that the next part of the dart system is all about tasks maybe you've tried to keep a to-do list before I know I have from the reminders app to good old pen and paper I've gone in and out of using one that is until the dart system made everything easier and gave a little bit more purpose to the specific app that I chose for my list seriously after I show 

you this next app and how it integrates with the calendar that you already have it's going to feel like breathing fresh air for the first time you see my issue with too lists whether they were electronic or AC acoustic analog was that they were all just a little bit too difficult to get to I'd have to rummage through my bag to find my notebook and then flip to the page where my to-do list for the day was or I'd have to remember where I shoved the reminders app off to so as fast as I'd start using a to-do list system whether it's pen and paper or the reminders app I'd stop using using it that was when I decided that the best 

to-do list would have these three qualities one it's just a single Tap Away two it lets you use natural language to quickly capture a task or a thought and three it integrates with your calendar so that you can see your tasks in the context of your other commitments that's why when I stumbled upon the app todoist I basically fell in love todoist is everything that I just mentioned and more you can type out your tasks and say when they're due like you're talking to a friend and it automatically slots your tasks into your calendar of choice you can organize 

tasks by project and you can organize projects by sections for example for my 95 job I have different sections for each role that I'm responsible for this makes it super easy for me to slot a task into the exact section in the project that I know that it belongs in so that I can get things done in a more systemized manner we'll go over how to launch to-do list and other apps from the lock screen in just a second but before we do remember this find a to-do list app that works for you remember it's not the app that's going to change your life it's how you use the app and and to me that sounds like something 

worth noting down speaking of [Music] notes R in the dart system stands for records things you record or in simpler terms your notes similar to to-do lists I've gone in and out of using notes to certain degrees of intensity the reason I and probably you stop using a particular productivity function like to-do lists or notes or calendars is because of the ease of access which we're going to solve by the end of this 

video having a place for jotting down notes especially in our digital world is becoming increasingly more and more important because sometimes productivity doesn't come in the form of an event or a task maybe sometimes you want to capture a thought for later or save something that inspired you I find my nodes app particularly useful whenever I see something that inspires me for example if I'm designing something graphically and I see a design that I like online I'll just save it to my design inspo folder or maybe I see a quote that inspires me or makes me feel a certain way that I want to save to the 

database and folder that I've been building of thinkers that I want to Aspire to be like there's no point in picking apart all the specificities of a particular note- taking app because like the Calendar app the best Notes app that you have is the one that's already installed on your phone for me that's the Apple notes app that comes stock with all Apple devices because Apple still has me on a choke hold and I use Thiago Forte's second brain philosophy to organize it there's so many videos about it online and I'm not going to explain it better than the creator of the second brain system so definitely check out thiago's videos on how you can 

build out your own digital note-taking environment find a system that works for you and stick to it because the only wrong way to use a Notes app is to not use it all three of the apps that we've gone over so far cover the main parts of productivity that we need to keep track of we've gone over an app for keeping track of dates for knowing where and when you need to be we've gone over an app for keeping track of action items for knowing what you need to get done we've gone over an app for recordkeeping for notes that you want to take on things that inspire you and motivate you but how do we keep these apps all tied together how do we ensure we create a 

smooth and frictionless experience when it comes to unlocking that superhuman level of productivity that's where our next and final part of the dart system comes into play and let me tell you you're not going to want to tap away from this video I didn't really come up with a creative transition as creative as the other ones for [Music] this if the te part of the dart system was a person it would be a mom I am your mother and I know you moms are like the 

conductors in the crazy disjointed Orchestra of Life they're working overtime making sure that appointments are met that things get done and they're usually the ones taking notes on the things that we'll inevitably forget they're also responsible for streamlining processes which is at the core of the tea part of Dart tea part of Dart say that five times fast the T stands for Taps and serves as a reminder to keep the other three methods of productivity capture no more than a couple Taps away while there's not really one specific app for this part of the system as you can lay out your own 

home screen in a way that works for you there's one that I found that definitely helps earlier on I was showing you how easy it was to implement parts of the dart system from a locked phone while some apps have widgets that can now live on your lock screen others don't this is where lock flow comes into play it's an app that allows you to launch any app on your phone from the lock screen it can even launch custom shortcuts so you can probably already see the benefit of this I wanted the dart system to be as frictionless as possible I don't want to spend time even searching through my app library for the to-do app or my notes app so finding lock flow was 

instrumental in building the system and really tying it all together it makes it so that all three of the other productivity apps in the system are immediately accessible from the lock screen which is the state that my phone is in when I first pick it up it also in a way removes the temptation to be distracted by other things like social media or the internet when I'm trying to open just the calendar or to-do list or notes because I'm launching it from the lock screen not from my app Library so whether or not you use something like lock flow the importance of tea in the dart system is a reminder to always make 

sure that your productivity apps are as accessible as possible have a system for writing how am I supposed to tr hey hey are you getting any of this sorry what was that when did I say the Anderson account numbers are due uh looks like the 18th okay and what three deliverables are you completing by Tuesday I am finishing the email for next Friday's launch I'm checking in with a producer about the mood board and I'm uploading the completed short form pieces to Google Drive okay and how about for the notes on the meeting that we had just sent you and your assistant 

a link to collaborate huh how did you do all that so fast it was easy everything was just a tap away I built the dart system to ultimately remove all of the friction between productivity organization and taking action on the things that need to get done it can handle anything life throws at you in just the snap of a finger or I guess the tap of a finger that's probably the better analogy to Ed in the context of of this from important dates that you want to keep track of or notes on things that inspire you the dart system helps you keep everything 

that you need literally at your fingertips and remember the dart system isn't the Bible for productivity it's more of a framework for finding groups of apps that work for you sometimes I hop through different productivity apps like a kangaroo at a trampoline park there's so many different productivity apps to choose from and that's okay find one that works for you in each category of the dart system and stick to it for lasting progress in fact I would love to hear what apps you would use in the dart system so let me know in the comments below now that we have that out of the way and we know what the dart system is let's go get some work done if you liked 

this video then you'll probably like the next video thanks so much for watching I hope this helped and remember keep scrolling [Music] mindfully
