I have extensively worked with and factually adopted dozens of applications you can ever come across within the AppStore — **Agenda**, **Evernote**, **Things 3**, **Craft**, **SimpleNote**, **OneNote**, **TickTick**, **NotePlan, Bear, Drafts,** and so much more. But I gotta admit that I kept returning to **Apple Notes** despite its comparatively limited functionality and simplicity.

I started to analyze. What is so special about **Apple Notes**? What is there that other tools miss that keep me turning to Apple’s default app? I came up with the following list:

* It’s there *for* you from the very beginning. You just do things right away.
* Its initial configuration is perfect. It’s just a couple of checkboxes you may ever want to adjust, but none of them are mandatory.
* Simplicity in essentials. The application is so simple, it does not require any effort to configure (hi, *Notion*). Yet it covers all the basic blocks that you may use to build up more complex workflows if needed. Multiple folder layers, Smart Folders, Tags — all this allows you to take reasonable control over how exactly you would like to structure your content. Meanwhile, it does not overcomplicate everything with granular configuration abilities.
* Deep integration into the OS and overall device logic bundled with straightforward UI
* **Spotlight** integration — all of the information you will ever store in it will be available via just one single move (top-down swipe on the iPhone’s home screen, or *CMD + Space* on MacOS or iPad with Magic Keyboard)
* **Quick Note** functionality provides the ability to populate content easily — it is available with a simple single gesture and provides access to the most recent Note created. That is an important part of the workflow and it works equally well on all Apple devices.
* **Share Menu** resident — another feature very important for the content population. **Apple Notes** has a super easy way to get content from other applications.
* Seamless and secure synchronization of the content between the devices. Security here is probably an even more important part — because if you are going to operate with some business- or company-related information, you have to take into account where exactly a tool stores your data. How secure are those 3rd party servers you are relying on? In some cases, they are actually far from being secure. **Apple Notes**, in its turn, fully relies on **iCloud** which nowadays can have multiple layers of protection, including MFA and encryption. You are safe with **Apple Notes**.
* Content-agnostic. **Apple Notes** does not care what you throw at it. Weblinks, PDFs, Images, Music files, Youtube videos, Handwritten notes, Sketches, Docs — **it just does not matter**. Every type of file or content will feel at home and equally respected resident of your storage.
* It works **offline** perfectly.

So, at first sight on this list, nothing super-duper. But if you try to find the whole package of points in any other application, you will most probably not be able to.

> *It was a surprise to me how Apple Notes is far from just storing text-based notes. It’s one of the best all-around and versatile choices you may find to build a personal information management system.*
