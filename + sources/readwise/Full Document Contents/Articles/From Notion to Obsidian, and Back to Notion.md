- Summary: The author discusses their experience switching between Notion and Obsidian, two note-taking and organization tools. They highlight the benefits of Obsidian, such as its support for citations and LaTeX math, making it useful for academic writing. However, they ultimately switched back to Notion because of its ability to easily attach complex media and sync between different devices. The author also compares Notion to Evernote, noting that Notion's use of blocks with unique IDs makes it powerful. They mention some drawbacks of Notion, such as the need to export references in markdown style, but overall, they find Notion to be a more flexible and reliable choice for their needs.

## Full Document
I’ve been going back and forth between Notion and Obsidian. Previously, I wrote that Obsidian is a fantastic tool for academics with the bibtex plugin, which allows for easy access to citations, as well as inbuilt support for Latex math via MathJax. It’s fantastic for quickly drafting up ideas and perhaps even full papers. I’ve written up two of my recent papers on Obsidian, although admittedly they were more position papers than full-blown technical work, but it was a very enjoyable process.

However, even though I can organize my thoughts and structure ideas in a text editor, the ability to easily attach complex media and other kinds of attachments, as well as input ideas on mobile, made me switch back to Notion. For the last few weeks, I’ve been working on a whole bunch of things on Notion, including preparing a fairly complex rich media document that I had to submit on our lab’s previous results. I have to say, for these kinds of things, Notion is far more powerful than Obsidian. Of course, I can use Obsidian to attach documents as well, but something about Notion’s sync between different devices, as well as the fact that these attachments are not sitting on my desktop and being synced seamlessly, just makes me feel a bit safer using Notion. I use iCloud sync with Obsidian, and it works fine, but having the ability to use Notion’s custom sync solution between the desktop and mobile makes it a bit more flexible and relaxed.

It’s interesting to compare Notion and Evernote. Evernote also allows rich media documents, but it’s not quite the same thing. What makes Notion really powerful is having different blocks, and all of these blocks have their own unique IDs, which can be moved around, so it’s incredibly powerful.

I haven’t tried writing a paper yet on Notion, and some things are a bit worse in Notion. For instance, I would need to export references from bibdesk in the markdown style, and they annoyingly use double dollar signs for math, but I think I can get past this, so it’s Notion for now.

For a while, I was even toying with having both of them side by side, which I might end up doing in the future, but there’s something very nice about leaving off a document at one point and picking up exactly where you left off, all in the same software framework, and that’s why I’m doing all-Notion for now.
