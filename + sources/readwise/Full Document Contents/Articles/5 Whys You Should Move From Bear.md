- Summary: The author of the article recommends switching from the note-taking app Bear to Obsidian for several reasons. They highlight the lack of certain features in Bear, such as backlinks and a graph view, which Obsidian already offers. They also note that Obsidian has had significant updates in 2022, including pop-up windows, browser-like tabs, and the addition of Canvas for visualizing ideas. The author emphasizes that Obsidian has a robust community of plugins and a multi-platform availability, unlike Bear. They provide reasons why someone might choose to use Bear, such as its simplicity and polished design, but ultimately argue that Obsidian offers more flexibility and functionality.

**Quick summary:** *If the current Bear functionality doesn’t cover your needs — don’t wait, switch NOW.*

And now in more detail.

Almost a year ago I moved from Bear to Obsidian and don’t regret it at all. Before this, I have been using Bear for 1.5 years. After the switch, I lost the perfection of Bear, but I received a much more powerful tool for my Second Brain. Now I am not limited by what app developers offer me, but by the open-source plugin community that is almost infinite. Give it some time, and every lacking use case will be covered by Obsidian’s developers or the community. For example, Obsidian already has some start of [Notion-like databases](https://rafaelgb.github.io/obsidian-db-folder/) (and [projects](https://github.com/marcusolsson/obsidian-projects)) and [AI integration](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-ai/).

The main reason for me to move from Bear to Obsidian was the lack of a basic feature that is so EASY to implement, but not for Bear developers — **Backlinks** (and Graph view). Yes, I know about their beta version with Backlinks, but it is in development since 2020 (*more than 2 years!*). And knowing Bear’s speed of development, I won’t recommend anyone to wait for an update soon. Another good example of their speed is Bear for Web: the first [developer mention](https://www.reddit.com/r/bearapp/comments/71y32a/comment/dng13qn/) about it that I found on Reddit was **5 years** **ago**! And now it is [delayed](https://www.reddit.com/r/bearapp/comments/h9frzq/comment/fuwd5ph/) before the Bear 2.0 release…

Below I will provide my highlights from both apps changelogs in 2022 to give you a sense of their progress during the year. Yes, Obsidian will destroy Bear in numbers, but this is NOT the only thing that matters.

### The best Obsidian updates in 2022

What changed in Obsidian in 2022? — **A lot.**

This year Obsidian got a few powerful updates that dramatically changed how you can interact with your notes. The first update is [v0.15.6](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-release-v0-15-6/40227) in which Obsidian received Pop-up windows. Yes, Bear had it before Obsidian, but it is the only exception.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*YK6Yuxo_HqGoRqCR)Obsidian Pop-up window 
Next, in October Obsidian finally had its «release» with [v1.0.0](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-release-v1-0-0/44873). This time it received browser-like tabs, tabs stack, and design refinement. Now, while in Bear you could only open notes in the main or pop-up window, in Obsidian you have **4 options!** (main, split, tab, tab-stack). Each one fits better for a different use case.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*lPS_dG1qWsN4GA05)Obsidian Browser-like tabs and tabs stack 
This already could’ve been a great end of 2022 for Obsidian. But right before the New Year, there is another huge update [v1.1](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-release-v1-1) with the addition of [Canvas](https://obsidian.md/canvas) — a super-powerful tool for your notes. Now you can lay out your ideas in 2D space, and you don’t need to switch between apps when you want to brainstorm or visualize connections, EVERYTHING is inside the Obsidian!

There are a lot of updates in Obsidian in 2022 and I talked just about the app’s updates and nothing about the community plugins. Of course, not every plugin is good enough to recommend, but plenty of them are so good that they should be included in Obsidian by default.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*ttdX1UuUfcfaCu9i)[Obsidian plugins collection](https://obsidian.md/plugins) 
Plugins — is a big difference between Obsidian and Bear. While Bear tries to deliver the most polished app with sacrifice on functionality, Obsidian builds a platform where the community can build what they need. With a later approach, you as a user can deeply configure the app for your personal needs and style.

### What changed in Bear in 2022

**Nothing.** The last Bear update on iOS was **8 months** ago and **11 months** ago on macOS. And those updates are bug fixes mostly to the notes export function. From one point of view, it is awesome that we have such a stable app. Just think about it, 11 months without bug fixes to core functionality, because everything just works! From another point of view, if you miss some feature in Bear, you can’t expect to get it soon (*or get it at all*). In 2023 you have COMPLETELY the same app, that you had a year ago.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*aDGofbu2uEUrNYi-)Bear App Store on macOS — 20.01.2023 
![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*txrjEkhiILBgBM2V)Bear App Store on iOS — 20.01.2023 
OK, there is Bear 2.0 (beta), the [first activity](https://beta.bear.app/t/panda-release-notes-1-0-566-autocomplete-and-images-resize/761) on the beta forum dated Aug 2020 and it’s still not released! But even when it’ll be released, it’ll bring just a few new features and many of them are just formatting and UI/UX improvements.

List of major changes to Bear that I found:

* **Live preview**
* **Backlinks**
* **OCR search**
* **Tables**
* **Table of contents**
* Footnotes
* New toolbar
* Better formatting
* Better UI

Again, nobody still knows when Bear 2.0 will be released. Just for reference, Bear is [promising a Web version](https://www.reddit.com/r/bearapp/comments/71y32a/comment/dng13qn/) since **Sep 2017**. It was 5 years ago, so according to [Lindy’s effect](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Lindy_effect), most likely it won’t be released for another 5 years 🙃

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*kMbvI2VZPlq6TVTf)Bear developer comment on the Web version in Sep 2017 
Moreover, all of the “new” Bear’s features (except great UI/UX) are already available in Obsidian. And with time Obsidian will receive even more powerful features, but Bear most likely will stay THE SAME.

### What changed in Bear 2.0 in 2022

**Something.**

We can’t know all the work done in Bear 2.0, but the biggest changes they publish on their [beta forum](https://beta.bear.app/c/releases/). In [March](https://beta.bear.app/t/panda-check-in-integration-search-and-todos/2587) and [April](https://beta.bear.app/t/panda-check-in-3-ios-search-export-all-the-things-more/2683), they showed In-note search on iOS (*yes, only now*) and improvements to PDF export. In [July](https://beta.bear.app/t/panda-release-7-18-ocr-and-ios-keyboards/), they showed OCR (a *cool feature, but Obsidian has plugins for this*) and the all-new iOS keyboard. Then only in [November](https://beta.bear.app/t/bear-2-beta-update-9916/5270), they showed Wiki-links aliases (*yes, only now*), and in [December](https://beta.bear.app/t/forum-feedback-backlinks-and-info-column/5926) when Obsidian added Canvas for all users, Bear added Backlinks (*yes, only now*) for beta version users.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*aE_K28Ae8aLGCROp)Bear iOS In-note search and Backlinks 
Yet, even after the Bear 2.0 release it still **won’t** have Graph view, Canvas, and Community Plugins. Moreover, Bear doesn’t have Android, Windows, and Web (*long-promised*) versions, you might not need it now, but later.

### 3 Whys you might use Bear

#### 1. You need a simple notes app and for some reason, you don’t like Apple Notes

I understand why people like Bear. It’s fast, easy to use, and polished. Also, Bear is a great choice if you prefer Markdown over Apple Notes formatting. $15 a year for such an app is a fair price.

#### 2. You prefer a perfectly built app rather than a powerful AND you are completely satisfied with the current Bear’s functionality

Given the speed of development of Bear, no matter how good the Bear is, if you miss any important feature, you better move now. Because later, when you will have more notes organized in Bear’s specific style, it will be only harder.

#### 3. You need a great export feature for publishing

While I was reading Bear’s changelogs I spotted that they really care about the export function. But not to move your notes to another place, but to share/publish your notes in PDF. Maybe if it’s your use case, then Bear is for you, but my primary use case for notes is knowledge and project management.

### 5 Whys you should move from Bear to Obsidian

#### 1. You are not limited in what you can do

During my time with Obsidian as a primary note-taking app I tried many powerful built-in tools: Backlinks, Graph view, and Canvas, as well as plugins: Dataview, Excalidraw, and Kanban. After this, I am not willing to return to the limited Bear.

#### 2. You are not limited in notes organization

Obsidian doesn’t limit you to one way of organization of your notes. Bear requires you to use Tags, but in Obsidian you can use whatever you like: Tags, Folders, or Links. And you can use all of them for different purposes. Yes, with all of these together, the organization process becomes more complicated. But you don’t need to rush to use everything, start slowly and you will find a practice that suits you.

#### 3. You are not limited to Apple products

Bear is available only on Apple, while Obsidian is available on macOS, iOS, Android, Windows, and Linux. My primary tools are MacBook and iPhone, but it is still better to stay away from apps that are limited to one platform. Especially if an app is for something important like notes.

#### **4. But if you are on Apple, then you can sync notes for free**

[Obsidian Sync](https://obsidian.md/sync) (encrypted sync for notes) is a little pricer than Bear and costs $96 a year, but if you use iCloud you can still sync your notes for free. Also, you can find other free ways to sync notes in community plugins. But I still prefer the official Obsidian Sync because it is easy and it provides a **one-year version history** (*Bear doesn’t have version history*), making it easy to revert to an earlier version if anything goes wrong.

#### 5. Big and Active community

When you search for content on Bear most of the videos will be quite old, but Obsidian has a big and active community. You can always find many tutorials on any topic or plugin. Here are 2 of my favorites that are the least theoretical and more practical channels: [FromSergio](https://www.youtube.com/@FromSergio) and [Nicole van der Hoeven](https://www.youtube.com/@nicolevdh). And here are 2 more great resources: [LinkingYourThinking](https://www.youtube.com/@linkingyourthinking) and [Danny Talks Tech](https://www.youtube.com/@DannyTalksTech).

### Ending

You don’t need to move out from Bear in 1 day, most likely it will take some time to adapt to a new app. And if you decided to move from Bear to Obsidian, I have a step-by-step tutorial on how I did it myself. [#### How to successfully move notes from Bear to Obsidian

* Graph view ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WIALfgaA4)) — lets you visualize the relationships between your notes.
* [Canvas](https://obsidian.md/canvas) — an infinite space to visualize and make sense of your ideas.
* [Excalidraw](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/excalidraw-full-featured-sketching-plugin-in-obsidian/17367) — a whiteboard that lets you easily sketch diagrams that have a hand-drawn feel to them.
* [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) — treat your Obsidian Vault as a database which you can query from.
* [Kanban](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban) — create markdown-backed boards.

And don’t forget to explore another [800+ plugins](https://obsidian.md/plugins) and cancel your Bear subscription 😉
