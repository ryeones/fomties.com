hey friends welcome back to the channel this is going to be my annual is Life Update video so if you care then you might like to watch some of this video there'll be time stamps down below um I'm going to touch on three main things number one the Life Update number two the business update and number three just a few Reflections a few thoughts a few bits and Bobs that I've been thinking about and there'll be time stamps to everything down below if you feel like skipping around so let's start with a life update so lots of things have been going on in my life uh firstly I got married [Music] 

I met a lovely lady a few years ago her name is Izzy and she's also a YouTuber we actually met in medical school because we went to the same College we were both medical students at Emanuel College Cambridge uh but we really connected afterwards through the YouTube stuff she was also a former student of my part-time YouTuber academy uh her YouTube channel is now absolutely blown up and the room next door in this house is going to be her own YouTube studio for stuff that she's doing but anyway yeah we got married in August August of 2024 and then after getting married we 

decided we were going to move to Hong Kong and so I have also we have also moved to Hong Kong where I am right now and will be for at least the next year maybe longer depending on whether we like it so on the marriage front Izzy and I were together for 3 years is before we got married and we deliberately kept the relationship sort of like under wraps um some people kind of figured it out like uh based on triangulating Instagram stories and the fact that you know we went to the same same medical school and stuff people had kind of clocked and the fact that I've sort of been uh referencing the fact 

that I've had a girlfriend for the last couple of years like some some people on the internet figured it out but for the most part not really knew I think for the most part no one really cared one thing that I am Keen to do moving more for moving forward is have certain aspects of my life that are a little bit more private rather than for public consumption I think when it comes to my own stuff my own like business finances in my own life I'm very happy sharing very sharing a lot of stuff publicly but as soon as someone else gets involved D 

like another person like a wife or potentially kids further down the line it's a big question mark in my mind of like how much to really share about that stuff online some part of me wants to because I think you know Izzy and I have talked about maybe doing some like joint videos where we share like relationship tips that have worked for us that we because she also really enjoys reading books about relationships and things like that and we think that would be cool but we don't want the relationship to become content as it were and we know so many people who do like Rel relationship content and there's always 

a bit of a risk that when your life and your relationship becomes the content and becomes your livelihood oh God that's a wow that's a it's a bit of a nightmare to deal with and I know people who have had like loads of bad things happen in their real life as a result of the pressure and scrutiny and stuff that comes on their relationship through social media and content and stuff so it's something that we're thinking a lot about um not in any major rush to I don't know do relationshipy type stuff 

on the internet we probably won't given that you know my stuff is most mostly personal development in business her stuff is mostly personal development in language learning there's almost no need to bring the relationship side of things into it but we'll see we we haven't quite figured out yet there's a book called the second Mountain which I read last year I think it's by David Brooks and the idea is that there are two mountains in life the first mountain is the mountain of freedom and the mountain of success and the mountain of like getting rich and stuff and then you climb that first mountain and then one of three three things happens either you 

get to the top of the mountain and realize it's not as fulfilling as you thought it would be or you get knocked off the mountain because either you have a health problem or like a major life event happens that knocks you off the first mountain and then you're in this Valley of Despair but then you realize in this Valley that there is actually a second mountain and that is a taller Mountain than the first mountain and the second mountain is the mountain of commitment the mountain of investment the mountain of like going deep on like a relationship a community a cause a faith whatever the thing might be and 

what he argues in the book is while the first mountain is the mountain of like pleasure or whatever the second mountain is the mountain of true and Lasting Joy you know a lot of my friends a lot of my mentors are married and have families and stuff and they often talk about you know most of them are older than me they they talk about how like in their 20s and maybe early 30s they were focused on the first mountain of achievement and of success and of like trying to make something of themselves and then they got married they had a family and now they realized that like like you know 

traveling around all the time and having all these parties and drinking all the time and whatever whatever whatever is not that fulfilling it's not that fun and that in this second chapter of life or third chapter or how however you define life chapters in this next chapter of Life the true Joy comes from like committing to someone committing to a place like building building Roots rather than having wings this is something that um you know Tim Ferris talks about this in 4-Hour Work Week even at the end of 4our work week There's this whole chapter on filling the void that once you have the ability 

to do whatever you want you realize that oh actually I kind of need to find something to do uh in general so some sort of purpose that helps me be useful to other people that helps me grow in some ways you know through this business stuff through this YouTube channel through all the things I've done my fair share of traveling I've done my fair share of moving around I experimented with the digital Nomad experiment like about a year ago and I kind of realized that yeah those things are fun in small doses but I like I quite enjoy life at home life at home is great get to hang out with the wife get to play Squash on 

a weekly basis get to play binton with the same group of friends don't need to fly places and stuff like in my 20s the thought of being a sort of I don't know Globe trotting business entrepreneur author creative person always flying to this place and that place and oh my goodness being able to fly business class and staying in fancy hotels all of that seemed like a really fun thing and it was a really fun thing and I you know I still enjoy it to some degree but now I'm just like you know what I I just 

love the day-to-day um I I I quite like the quote boring routine day-to-day life it's quite fun I don't really need that much novelty don't really need that much excitement I can like lock in set up my nice YouTube Studio not have to pack cameras up every time I want to make a video and like make a new setup in a whole new hotel room because like I'm in in a new city just kind of nice and I think that same philosophy applied to marriage like a relationship with this one person where you know you're seeing this person very often and it's just 

it's quite nice it's like deepening that relationship rather than it's like going deep rather than going broad if that makes sense so I mean I've been married for like a couple of months at this point but so far I'm very much enjoying married life it's great um reading books about it of course um going to make videos on some of those books at some point um yeah it's just generally generally a good place to be if anyone is watching this and is married um if you can comment down below I would love some marital advice anything you wish you'd known when you were a few months 

into your marriage would be kind of interesting uh interesting to hear cuz I'm always interested in learning from the wisdom of other people next up we have the move to Hong Kong so we decided to move to Hong Kong why did we decide to move to Hong Kong well the main reason to be honest was that Izzy does not like the weather in London London is really nice in terms of weather in like the summer months and we may spend probably want to spend the summer months in London anyway uh like sort of June July August time but for the rest of the time London is sort of kind of gray and a bit cold and a bit 

depressing that really affects Izzy more so than it affects me and so she was always saying that like hey look you know if this becomes a long-term thing I'm quite Keen to leave the UK and I was like yeah sure you know I'm not that attached to London I quite like it but it would be interesting to explore other parts of the world and so then the question became of like okay knowing that we want to leave London because of the weather primarily where do we want to go and so we kind of explored the us a little bit explored Miami explored La explored Austin spent a bit of time in 

San Francisco you know places where we know there are entrepreneur Creator type people and a bunch of friends of ours and things but broadly the US was quite similar to the UK it's just that the buildings were bigger the roads were bigger and the cards were big and the cars were bigger and like the portion sizes were bigger everything was just like was like bigger in the US but broadly it was fairly similar to the UK so you're thinking well what about Asia moving to Asia would be kind of fun like that's more dissimilar from the UK than the US is and be quite interesting and 

so we were like okay what are the sort of ma major cities in Asia where we could try out and so after a bunch of watching YouTube videos and looking at like taxes and looking at like residency options and looking at weather and looking at people that we knew who lived in these different places we sort of landed on three those three were Hong Kong Singapore and qual Lumpa in Malaysia Hong Kong Singapore Malaysia and and we were like all right cool where do we go first and initially we were like do we want to do the whole like 3 months 3 months 3 months thing do 

we want to sample all these different places but we were both sort of sick of the whole traveling thing and just liked the idea of actually committing to a place for at least a year setting down a few routes and then seeing if we could build a life there and then we spoke to a few friends who had spent time in all three all three of these major cities and broadly the consensus was that in the absence of us trying them out ourselves and we still wanted we wanted to visit I mean I've been to Singapore a couple of times uh a bunch of times uh want to visit Malaysia on holiday but the broad sensus was that Hong Kong is 

actually a great place to be Hong Kong has a lot going for it the weather is great there's a lot of greenery like 80% of Hong Kong is like national parks and so wherever you look there's like a BN like tons of greenery but there's also like high-rise buildings and stuff which is kind of cool Hong Kong is also very well internationally connected like it's easy to get to the airport and the airport flies direct literally everywhere um Singapore has that as well qual lumper less so like there's there's fewer direct flights from kale to other places and given that I do travel some of the time for work stuff and friends and family and stuff I wanted a place that has really good International links 

so that's why we settled to Hong Kong we were like you know what let's just try Hong Kong a bunch of friends recommended Hong Kong would be the place that we'd probably like most and so we got here tried it out for a few weeks and we were like you know what yeah we can see ourselves living here and so we just decided to commit to at least being here for a year we've rented a place for at least a year setting up shop and trying to find a local squash club and Bonton club and Tennis Club to join and you know all of the stuff just sort of building a life around this being being here in Hong Kong pretty cool place so far if anyone happens to be in Hong Kong um I'm actually in the market for friends so drop me an email um and at 

some point when my inbox becomes less of a cesspit of random crap I will have a look through the emails and we'll see I'll ask someone on my team to sort of filter through and see if like oh there's like a few people in Hong Kong who want to hang out and I've already actually hung out with with a couple of people who've like dm' me on Instagram and stuff so do feel free to reach out if you would like to be friends in Hong Kong in particular if you have recommendations for like squash and binton and Tennis to play without having to pay the absolutely extortionate fees for these like clubs and stuff and like to be honest the main life change from being being here is just being that it's 

just really nice it's really nice having a routine it's really nice having stability it's really nice being able to say that like yeah I could take singing singing lessons where every Monday evening I I am in fact available or like hey each morning I can go for a walk in the neighborhood thing outside and get a coffee coffee from the same place and I can actually spend the first four hours of my day working on a YouTube video or whatever the most important thing uh to do workwise is whereas for the last year my life has kind of been all over the place where you know traveling here and there different places never not really 

having a proper Studio setup except for like you know a month or two at a time doing a bunch of stuff related to book promotion publicity and it's it's been a bit all over the place whereas now for the first time in a in a long time I feel like ah I'm settled down in a place for at least a year I've got a solid routine no major travel plans happening just on the horizon and so I can now set up a nice YouTube studio and like make it look pretty and like join the local squash club and stuff without having to cancel every other session that I'm going to because like I'm traveling or 

something like that so I just love the routine maybe I'm becoming super boring I'm just a boring kind of guy but like there's something about boring stability and routine that is really fun um in a way that like constantly the constant novelty of like the globe trotting entrepreneur lifestyle wasn't really to be honest okay so that was a bit of a Life Update anything else on the Life Update front got married moved to Hong Kong going back to London for a bit I think like next week to see my brother's new baby he's had a baby um we did an episode of our podcast not 

overthinking if you want to hear my conversation with my brother about like what it's like being a new dad which is kind of interesting that is pretty much the Life Update let's now move on to part two which is the business update broadly we make a bunch of free content and some percentage of our audience will convert into paying customers and then that funds the production of the free content and it's just sort of this infinite game I always think and I've talked about this repeatedly but like I always think if I if I had all the money in the world what would I do differently and if I had all the money in the world I probably wouldn't sell paid courses 

I would just make stuff online and make stuff and stick it for free on the internet probably I might still do some paid courses cuz there is something around you know people who pay pay attention and there is something about like when a customer is actually paying for something they treat it differently compared to if it was just available for free but broadly if I had all the money in the world and all the time in the world I would continue doing this I would have a nice room in my house where I can film videos I would film videos a couple of times a week sharing stuff that I've learned sharing like documenting the Journey of whatever's going on I would want to have a family I'd want to read books about 

relationships make videos about those books I'd probably want to continue growing business just for the fun of it like build new products we've built a new app called voice pal recently which has been great so far it's got about 2500 paying users which is fantastic so these days the way I create content is that I go on a walk with my airpods in hit record and voice pal and I just sort of Spiel random thoughts like it transcribes it uploads it figures out what I'm talking about and it asks sensible follow-up questions and then I can answer the follow-up questions and I can just talk and this has just been amazing because now for me make a YouTube video or plan a YouTube video or 

even like write a module for one of our courses I don't have to sit at my desk hunched over like a you know whatever I can just be walking around in the nice sunshine and around the trees and stuff here in Hong Kong and I can just talk if I had all the time and money in the world I would build cool stuff like that stuff that actually helps me helps me be more productive more creative whatever and release those as products that would be cool I still make YouTube videos I still write books and so for the last few years my answer to that question has been fairly static it's been like yeah I actually am doing the thing where if I 

won the lottery there's not a lot I would change about what I'm doing and that's a great place to be that is the place I think it would be you know I would love it if everyone in the world obviously this it's never going to happen but I would love it if more people were at the point with their own life and their own business where winning the lottery wouldn't substantially change anything and I think that's that's a cool like lens through which to view goal setting and personal development and business growth and stuff it's like if you had all the time and money in the world what are the major changes you would make to your life I like all right cool do you need 

all the time and money in the world to make those major changes there are so many people I've met who are in jobs that they don't like where the job pays really well and I'm like why why are you still doing this job and I'm like oh cuz I need the money like do you I I know for a fact that you have at least X in savings and like you've paid off most of your house mortgage do you really need the money like do you really need that money to put bread on the table and they're like well huh maybe not actually and it starts to sort of tweak some screws in the mind and former update and thing and 

things I think it's too easy to be stuck in a job you don't enjoy because you think you need the money if you actually need the money then of course the situation changes but I don't know a lot of people a lot of people who watch this channel if you're a corporate professional with a 9 to5 like a lot of the people who have productivity lab speaking to people like you probably you're probably not on the poverty line you probably don't need that job to put bread on the table you could probably get a lower paid job that is more fulfilling and still put bread on the table I don't know man easy for me to 

say because like I switched from medicine to YouTube which ended up being way higher paying than medicine but I don't know I don't know thankfully the business is still broadly the same in that it's still broadly the thing that I would do if if I won the lottery uh there are a few changes we're making to the business um one thing that we're doing is really simplifying things so over the last few months we've been attempting to I don't know attempting to build the business in a more scalable way so what does that mean well we were trying to spin off our 

YouTuber Academy into its own mini business and trying to spin off our productivity lab into its own mini business I was thinking at some point I want to start like an online business school where I do videos and courses and stuff helping people start online businesses and that would was going to be its own thing but it just like over complicated the absolute Living Daylights out of everything trying to build like three or four different brands rather than just focusing on my personal brand like al.com or you know the alal YouTube channel and just just doing everything within this 

and a big part of why we over complicated things was I had this should in my mind of I should build the business in a way that is scalable and sellable scale and sale were the two shoulds in my mind the scale thing was like okay well I guess I should build a business cuz it's the right thing to do to build the business in a way that doesn't rely on me what if I decide one day to not do the YouTube thing anymore well the business would crumble yeah what if I get hit by a bus well then the business would die yeah it would if it's so reliant on my personal brand and so I 

thought the thing that I should do as a business owner is drisk the business from me in the sense of in theory if we build other products and other brands those products can scale in a way that isn't correlated with me just making more and more YouTube videos maybe that was one sort of should I should do this the other should was that I should build a business where I've got the option to sell it further down the line spoke to a couple of mentors and they were like yeah you know right now you might not want to sell but hey if you have a few kids and suddenly you want to reduce the amount of time you're spending making content and stuff it would be nice to 

have the option to sell the business for you know 1020 million I was like yeah it would be nice to have the option to sell the business for 1020 million yeah sure okay um and I was like okay well I guess I guess that seems kind of sensible I guess we got to build these separate Brands and grow them as separate businesses not realizing that a that is a huge amount of work B it's actually really hard to do it's so hard to grow a business especially if you're trying to decorrelate it from a personal brand that's already working a big thing in business that I've realized is just take the thing that's working and keep on 

doing it until it until it stops working me continuing to do personal brand stuff selling courses under my name making YouTube videos under my name not trying to get other team members involved in like showing up in the content and turning it into like a cast of characters a YouTube channel it still works and it's still fun so like as long as that continues to be the case why not just double down on it and I realized that this is kind of going going all over the place but that's okay I realized that this this thing of like I should build a business in a way that someone might want to buy it was also a 

should and one thing I've realized recently is that shoulds are just not a good way to live life um I went on a retreat that was hosted by a lovely chap called Joe Hudson and his wife Tara who run an organization called The Art of accomplishment and they had this 7-Day intensive retreat in California and one of the big takeaways was that there are so many ways in which we should ourselves but every should has behind it some kind of Shame and some kind of whip 

it's like whenever you say oh I should do this it's like okay well I should do this okay but I'm not doing it but I really should do it and like I'm sort of mini flating myself every time I have this should like I should build a business in a way that I could sell one day like I don't I don't think I really want to but like I probably should because like yeah these mentors you know I respect them the smart people they're telling me something I might want further down the line so I probably should do it but every time there's a should there's this like resistance as as opposed to want to I want to make YouTube videos occasionally I think I should make a YouTube video but then I try and change it to be like 

no no no there's no should here like I don't have to make a YouTube video I can choose to make a YouTube video there's no should behind should I make a life update video every year I just kind of want to do it I know it doesn't get that many views I know it doesn't get that many new subscribers I know people broadly don't care because they want productivity advice or business advice which is fine but some some people like these videos and that's okay I enjoy making them I want to make this life update video it's a want rather than a should and because it's a want it happens but if it was a should I should make this video I should do this thing I should build the business in a way scale I should start getting other team 

members to feature on the channel so that we can drisk the business in theory and blah blah blah blah all of those shs just add a lot of negative energy to the whole process they make me rely on discipline rather than enjoyment to do the thing if if you've read my book or listen to the Audi book which you might like to feel good productivity the whole philosophy is if you find a way to enjoy the things that you're doing and also do things that you enjoy productivity takes care of itself you don't have to worry so much about being disciplined or about any of this stuff and I realized that all these shs were over complicating the business I wasn't having fun things 

weren't even working that well because it's really hard to build separate Brands distinct from me or distinct from a personal brand and after a lot of soul searching I decided you know what screw it let's forget about trying to build the business in a way that could sell let's forget about trying to scale the business and reduce the keyman risk and like yeah if I stop making YouTube videos one day yes the business will crumble and that's okay I'm sure everyone in the team can find another job the fact that they have worked for me at some point will help them learn new jobs I don't need to worry about that I can in fact build a business and 

this is has been a liberating Insight I can in fact build a business where I can actually just do what I want um and not worry about like the livelihood of the team CU they'll be fine and having this should of like oh I should build a business so that we can continue to employ people forever I mean no one stays with the same employer forever like it's just you know life is impermanence life is changed all that kind of stuff I just realized that there was all these shs attached to it that there was no need for and I can in fact just do whatever I want which was also the realization I had kind of last year when I made a 

similar Life Update video it's like oh I can just make YouTube videos whenever whenever I feel like it but I I I sort of like I don't know if you have this maybe if you're a business owner or actually in life I don't know if this is like a thing but I I often do this thing where I sort of like flip-flop between these things and it's sort of like the place I always land on is hm I can in fact choose to do whatever I want but then sort of like the entropy of the universe and like being surrounded by the people and reading books and getting advice takes me into 

the territory of but I could make more money and I could scale and I could sell and that would be a good thing to do and I'm like yeah you know oh yeah I think I think this is it I have a few months of like I can do whatever I want that generates a lot of energy where I'm like ah I'm enjoying my work I'm super productive Super Creative because I'm doing what I want things are happening effortlessly this is also effortless it's it's almost too easy it's too fun and then I'm like oh right now I'm doing what I want and it's really fun I could 

just keep doing that and also make more money and also scale and also this and also that and then this energy goes into this scale project and then the Energy starts to go down I'm like H H this is actually kind of hard I'm not sure if I really want this uh H why don't I just go back to kind of doing whatever I want and making more profit and having fun and like not having to discipline myself to actually show up and and do the work yeah let's go back to that and I'm sure I see this pattered myself repeatedly over the years I'm sure that in a few months I'll 

speak to someone they're probably going to be American they're probably going to be making way more money than I am and they'll be very confident almost certainly going to be male and they're going to with sheer confidence tell me hey Oli you know what you really should be doing oh you know it would be so cool if you did blah blah blah and in the moment I'll think yeah that does sound really cool yeah of course if I could wave a magic wand I would have the ability to sell the business for 20 million yeah sure why I should do that and I I'll sort of scop myself into 

getting behind that desire but actually a a book I read a while ago is called wanting the power of mimetic Desire by a guy called Luke Burgess and we're going to do a video about it at some point it basically talks about this thing called mimetic theory that this guy called Rene Girard came up with which is that we often don't know what to want and so we adopt the desires that other people around us want especially if those people are people that we look up to so if I see someone I look up to them for various things and I see that what they want is a $20 million exit or a $50 

million exit I will start to want that as well at least temporarily um a mistake that I've made repeatedly over the years is to take that temporary want and make changes to the business based on that temporary want something that Luke talks about in the book is thick versus thin desires a thick desire is something that you've sort of always wanted I've always wanted to teach from the age of 13 I've been wanting to teach and I've been teaching in various capacities I've I've always been building stuff I've always been designing things from the age of like 12 been making websites and stuff that's 

like a thick desire it's like a thing that's sort of quite innate to me this desire to teach and this desire to create but the desire to sell a company for 50 million I've never once thought man this is something I really really really want there are some people who grow up in like startup land in like San Francisco the Bay Area or just some people who are wider that way who just love the idea since they were three they were like oh I want to exit a company for $100 million okay that's probably a thick desire for them it's probably something that they intrinsically authentically want but for me that I want to exit a 

company for 50 to 100 million even if we could get there I mean I'm I'm sure we could I back myself and our team to be able to do that if that's what we wanted but only if that want really aligns with my own core self or something and when I hear that and adopt someone else's desire cuz that's what they want and they're speaking about it in a confident way and I'm like yeah I look up to this person maybe I should want that as well I adopt it as a want for myself and then things go wrong in the business because like this thing 

the direction that we're going is not actually aligned to who I am internally let we come back to who I am internally I decide you know what I can just make videos whenever I feel like it I'm I'm content making a couple million in profit each year I don't need to make more than that that's like the core thing and then at some point I'm sure I'll adopt the mimetic desire of like you know actually I've met someone who lives there in Hong Kong and that place costs $20 million 20 million not even Hong Kong dollars 20 million 

Hong Kong doll would be really cheap that's only well really cheap it's only like2 million houses in Hong Kong bloody expensive absolutely insanely expensive we're renting at the moment because we actually cannot afford to buy because it's like it's just it's just too expensive but if someone's like if someone who I look up to is like who wants that thing and is living in it's the whole like keeping up with the Joneses thing I might find myself Desiring that really expensive house and then starting to do things to try and pursue more money because I'm like ooh I could get that membership to this country club that costs this much money 

and actually all these people I look up to they're all members of this country club and they say it's really good for their business cuz networking and stuff and to find a way to justify it and I'm sure this is going to happen where I'm going to be like oh I already want that thing and then we're probably going to try try to make more make more money in the business that's probably going to take me away from the thing I actually enjoy doing which is showing up to a camera coming up with new content ideas filming videos making courses talking to the team and then I'm probably going to come back to that and realize that actually that's not really what I want this is like the whole the whole roller coaster over time 

yeah I don't know if anyone can if anyone can relate but I I I find myself sort of in this in this pattern quite often at least like once a year and I would ideally like to reduce the amount of times I fall fall prey to this pattern so we are simplifying the business we've decided to scrap the idea of building multiple Brands we're just going back to the basics of like Al YouTube channel al.com the website which is getting a sick redesign looks absolutely sick and we'll just sell the product on al.com rather than trying to build these different brands and all 

this sort of stuff so that you know we landed on that decision a couple weeks ago it feels it feels right here's another thing this kind of going all over the place but that's okay here's another thing one thing that I've realized recently I'm just going to lean back because why not one thing I've realized recently is that how something feels is actually really important I mean when I was in my 20s in my sort of grind and hustle era how something felt was broadly meaningless and 

also I was like for for a very long time was wasn't very good at feeling my feelings and like yeah I would just sort of do stuff and be like forget you know feelings aren't facts like how you feel about this thing is irrelevant you're just going to do the thing anyway right and I think when I started figuring out this philosophy of like enjoyment and stuff that was when I really started to sort of feel the feelings and recognize you know when I was working in medicine like hm getting home to the end of the day and feeling like really low energy 

and kind of tired and not wanting to make a video H that's interesting I didn't label it as a feeling of like I feel sad or I feel depressed or whatever the thing might be I don't think I ever felt depressed but yeah I I never sort of labeled it as a feeling because I never really vibed with the internal feeling I just sort of had the sense that something was wrong but over time over the years especially being in relationship I've learned to identify my own like sematic experience the feelings in the body all that kind of stuff and know when something feels right 

versus when it doesn't feel right and there was something about this building multiple Brands and trying to build a business a scale that didn't quite feel right but I overrode the feeling with the thought of like no but this is a good thing to do it's sensible right and you should do this whereas now thinking about simplifying thinking about like yeah bringing everything back into the olll umbrella not worrying so much about like yeah if I stop making YouTube videos the business crumbles all of that feels really good there's no part of me that's like at least in terms of feeling 

there's no part of me that feels like that's a bad decision there's part of my brain you know the voice in the head is kind of like are you sure you sure this is a good idea you know what if we run out of money what if like business crumbles what if like YouTube algorithm changes what if people just like what if you just become irrelevant cuz no one gives a about what your opinions on productivity are anymore like what if ABCDE e like we we really should be doing that other thing over there but it's like this going going inward connecting with the man I sound so woo 

if I had heard myself say this like a few years ago I'd have been like this guy's this guy's off his rocker he's clearly taken some psychedelics and is one of those one of those weirdos but genuinely over the years I've become more I think I'm so I'm I this's part of me that feels so embarrassed at the fact that I'm saying this but also another part of me that's like yeah no this is this is my truth and I want to express my truth over the years just become better at like feeling my feelings and recognizing when something feels good internally and when it doesn't feel good internally I that's why the title of the book is Feelgood productivity I just 

thought of that I was speaking to one of my mentors his name is Olie Richards he's great he has a main YouTube channel which is about language learning and a second YouTube channel which is about building an online education business if you're interested in online education business you should check out his second Channel I'll put a link down below but something that Ollie and I were talking about as well was like you know he he asked the question of when you're when you're sort of pondering these different directions the business could go how do you feel energetically about them and a few years ago someone had asked me how do I feel energetically about this I'd have been like dude what 

the freak are you talking about but when Ollie asked that question a few months ago I was like Ah that's the right question how do I feel energetically ah I get it yeah I feel energetically weird about trying to build multiple Brands and build a business so so that one day I can sell it for 20 million or whatever but I feel energetically good about simplifying the business keeping it focused on just making just trying to make good content and keep it good and reading and learning more stuff and making videos about it and making a 

course every now and then and writing a book every now and then that feels energetically right and he was like H it's good to know that and yeah a big part of my decision- making now around things is what feels energetically right man I feel so woo saying that but it's fine it feels energetically right to kind of talk about this and since making this decision to simplify the business it really has felt like a whole breath of fresh I should stop invert coming feeling stuff it's really felt like a whole breath of fresh air going through my system going in some way 

through the team as well I was like ah now that we're not trying to build three different businesses and three different brands with the same siiz team oh okay we can just we can just really focus on oh it yeah we get it like just having one website oh my goodness that's so much more simple than having three different websites oh just having one online courses platform where we sell all of our stuff from one checkout oh that's such a breath yes so good oh my God what a nightmare it is to try and maintain three different checkout providers and three different checkout systems and check out stripe accounts 

which are going to three different bank accounts which are ultimately trying to go into three different p&l oh God what a nightmare that was but you can feel hopefully the the relief that's coming across as I'm like Hallelujah we are simplifying things man that feels good to get that off my chest a a nice what a nice feeling just be like yes simple simple is good I think at a certain stage of life you have to do the things that like you should do and stuff but it's it's sort of like what's 

the point of what's the point of building a business that is a prison for yourself these are I'm mostly just sort of speaking to myself here what is the point of building a business that's that's like a prison what's the point you got the money you quit the day job because you didn't enjoy the day job and now you're making all this money and you've got all this passive income and stuff there are no more shoulds you can in fact just do whatever the freak you 

want and you'll probably make a couple million of a couple of million dollars in profit every year to doing that that sounds pretty freaking good sounds pretty solid that is the place that a lot of a lot of my friends and like like entrepreneur friends are actually at that place where they're making you know low seven figures in profit or high six figures is in profit and they're really happy with it but there's always that siren Call of 

more of like oh but yeah you know what's cooler than 2 million 3 million you know what's cooler than 3 million 4 million you know that kind of thing and pretty much everyone that I've spoken to who has been on this journey has found that there is actually a sweet spot there's almost like a plateau there's almost like a glass ceiling where you know you could probably do a million and profit comfortably but getting to two 

would be quite uncomfortable getting to three would be kind of hard getting to 3 and5 like with the info product businesses you're probably having to run paid ads now paid ads were eat into your margins now you're having to figure out your return on ad spend and trying to liquidate ad costs fairly quickly and now the whole business becomes more stressful you're going to have ups and downs you're going to find that like you know yeah you can very comfortably make a million year in profit or two whatever the number might be but to get beyond that you're going to have to do big launches and those big launches are a bit fluctuant like you know you never really know how much money you're going to make from a big launch until the big 

launch happens and then you're going to start being like oh we didn't quite make enough money from that big launch so now we've got us bombard our audience with emails to try and convince them to buy this thing because we didn't get enough sales o now we start to get into stressful territory where it feels weird to be constantly selling this thing and stuff and sort of settling back down to this place of in a way it almost feels like a place of complacency and a place of mediocrity which kind of Vibes with Oliver burkman whole philosophy in 4,000 weeks very good book it feels like a 

complacency to be content with just making a million a year init what a what a champagne problem but it feels like complacency to not be growing you get all that stuff of like if a business is not growing it's dying and you should always be growing but it comes back to the point that I made in my last year annual video which I just keep on needing to remind myself of a friend of this told me once he was like growth doesn't have to be measured by the top line and the bottom line and growth can be found in different ways maybe maybe there's just no way to 

resolve this again I'd be I'd be curious if you've got to this point in the video and you can relate to what I'm saying in any capacity I'd love to know in the comments what you think may maybe there is actually no way to resolve this maybe this is just one of those situations of like there is a healthy tension between these two polls one pole is the pole of I want more and the other pole is the poll of I have enough and if you're like really Zen and spiritually enlightened and stuff you're like always in the I have enough category but at least for me I'm going to speak for myself it sort of feels like I'm constantly balancing on this sort of dynamic equilibrium between enough and more and maybe instead of 

viewing this as like I'm just kind of thinking a loud at this point maybe instead of me viewing this as like there is a solution here it's like the answer is to always be enough always feel like you have enough or to always be I don't know trying to grow the business maybe it is just accepting that hey there's no easy answers here no one I've ever spoken to has easy answers for this some people are more in the more Camp some people are more in the enough camp in different months and different seasons the same people are more in the more Camp versus in the enough camp um my friend Dan Priestley some of the time he's in more camp where he's like I 

want to build another business some of the time he's he's in enough camp or in the less camp where he's like actually I want to sell off some of these business assets so that I can focus on the on the core business when you're going to the gym there are periods of time where you're like okay this is a season of bulking and then at periods of time you're like this is a season of Maintenance and other times this is a season of cutting and maybe for me if I were if I were to just recognize that hey this is a dynamic equilibrium it would feel less bad when I'm too too much on one side I'm just like oh okay I 

can start to sentence myself going too much towards more let's let's slightly correct course we don't need to like upend and change the whole business but let's let's just change course a little bit if we're very much in the direction of more and then I realize uhoh then maybe it's time for drastic change or if we're like very much in the point of enough where it starts to feel complacent which we have been in at some points where things have started to decline because we haven't been putting in the energy okay cool let's start adding a adding in a Sprinkle of more like spice bit more hustle energy into this mix and I think a lot of the stuff 

like hustle versus chill toxic productivity all of this nonsense what everyone is kind of getting at is that there is a balance between work and chill balance between how much you want to work and how much you want to chill and actually that's basically this more vers is nothing it's a balance between work and chill do you want to work more do you want to chill more and a different seasons of Life a different times of the day different times of the week different times of month and year and stuff you may want to work more I may want to work more and I may want to chill more right now I I'm in more of a I want to work more in the 

sense of doing more of these videos cuz I enjoy it but I also want to chill more in the sense I want the whole business to be chill I want it to feel simplified yeah that would be nice I mean it's just that it's just that Balancing Act how much do you want to work and how much do you want to chill what are the goals what's a goal what's a plan what's a system if the goal is 10 million in an exit okay you got to work quite hard for that but is that really the goal should that be the goal is that really the goal that Vibes with you internally maybe maybe not if it is great go for it recognize that this is this Balancing Act and I think burnout comes from okay 

here's a hot take burnout comes from too much work but I also think there is a downside to Too Much chill which is like a feeling of stagnation and meaninglessness I know people who are periods of their life where they're like chilling a lot and they don't need to work or whatever people who sell their companies for like 20 million or whatever then have a period of chill where for about 2 or 3 weeks they're like hm okay I'm just chilling on the beach and then they start to get depressed because they have nothing to 

do and so too much chilling here's a hot take it's not it's not medically validated but too much work leads to burnout too much chill leads leads to depression o here we go yeah one thing that I read while researching my book was that the experience of burnout tends to actually be different in men and women in men the experience of burnout on average tends to manifest as a feeling of purposelessness in the work like oh what's the point of all this in women it tends to translate again broad generalizations don't cancel me broad generalizations and women in tends to translate into a feeling of being 

emotionally drained now I rarely feel emotionally drained but I do sometimes I think for me the sign of burnout is when the work starts to feel pointless like why are we doing all this and I've know as I Ah that's it I wrote this in the book like ah and I keep on needing to remind myself of the lessons that I researched and wrote in my own book which is that I've been over the last few months of us going in this direction of more more direction of work direction of build these Brands and build a businesses I have started to feel like what's the point I'm going to call with a web 

design team I'm like oh what's the point of Designing all these all these different websites like what's the point and that feeling of what's the point to me is probably an IND indication that actually I'm actually too much on the work side and actually hey let's let's do less let's chill the freak out let's like make things more simple reduce the complexity rather than keep going on this train of more I don't think I've ever been at a point in my in my life where I've had too much 

chill so I think I don't think I'm I'm at risk of that at all I think my knowing myself my inertia is generally towards more rather than towards less more towards work rather than towards chill and so really the correction that I'm always doing is in like okay I feel like I'm I'm working too much I'm trying to go too much for more let's simplify things let's like go for Less let's go for like simple rather than rather than scalable or rather than complex H nice okay like that I like how in these videos I just sort of treat the camera as a bit of a therapist and just 

sort of talk out loud and I have no idea how long this video is going to be I always say this in my Ram Life Update videos but usually I come to some pretty reasonable conclusions in the process of actually filming the video so there's this thing around like work and chill and for me I know my Tendencies to go too much toward towards the work therefore we probably want to sort of push it back towards the the sort of enjoyment the Simplicity the all of that sort of stuff anyway this video has gone long enough I think that is broadly wraps up our life update um if you are interested 

this is last year's Life Update if you're interested in how much overlap there is between the stuff that I've supposedly learned in the last 12 months and how much of it is just me relearning the same freaking lessons again and again and again and again man that's a thing it's just about relearning it's just about reminding ourselves of what we already know to be true and just coming back to that because there's a difference between knowing something and actually applying it and sort of knowing it to the point that 

it becomes internalized rather than just an intellectual thought process anyway that video is over there thank you so much for watching have a lovely day and I will see you hopefully in the next video bye-bye
