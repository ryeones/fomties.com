- Summary: To grow an audience, focus on consistent actions over time rather than quick success. Building a brand takes years of dedication, and success comes from committing to the process, not just the outcome. If you keep creating valuable content and engaging with your audience, your following will grow naturally.

## Full Document
People are making podcasts and thinkingin 90 days they're somehow going to blowup. In the beginning, 150 episodes is justme talking about how to run a gym better.I got a DM the other day from somebody whowas like, "Yeah, it's easy for you to buildthis brand because you already have thisbig audience." I was like, "Dude, just start."He was discouraged by the fact that hehad no following; he had no audience, etc.

Ninety-nine percent of people who are watching this domore cool things, and then you'll have coolthings to talk about rather than regurgitatingother people's stuff. But foreveryone who sees the overnight success,right, what I want you to do is go to mypodcast and look at the timestamp on myfirst episode. It's 2017, five and a half, sixyears ago; it just now hit the top 10, andin that six-year period, I did not missevery week 1 to 3 podcasts for sixyears. And so, people are making podcastsand thinking in 90 days they're somehowgoing to blow up when the reality isthat you're finding your voice for thefirst year. You're figuring out what wayyou communicate; you're learning how toteach, how to entertain, how to present.

You're learning how to speak, and you'realso learning about the stuff thatYou're learning, meantime, right? Like inthat period of time, I might not have hadas much stuff that was as cool in thebeginning that applied to as many people,'cause the first 150 episodes is just metalking about how to run a gym better.

Right around 150, I started talking aboutmarketing in general because that's whatI was into at the time, and then I startedtalking about sales, and I started talkingabout business in general, and M&A, andthings as they've evolved over time.

So the subject matter, as well as myskill in delivering it, both improvedover that period of time, and now thepodcast is top 10 in entrepreneurshipand very high-ranked in business, next tonames that I looked up to my wholecareer. I'm like, "Holy cow!" I'm like,"Wait, we just went above this guy thatI've been looking up to my whole life."It doesn't take 90 days; it takes years. Ifyou think in days, the time's going topass no matter what. But if you can thinkin decades, when you make your goals, whenthat decade does pass, it'll show thatyou were thinking that way, right? Not theoutcome of the goal. Make the action thegoal. If the action is, "Did I make thepost? Did I make the reach-outs every day?"Then you're a success; you check bothboxes. I want to tell you a quick story.

There was a guy who started at thefirst gym with me the same day, all right?We've been friends since then, and Istarted my gym, and then he started hisgym, and he started a chain of gyms. So wewent in parallel, all right? He endedup selling those gyms, and he wanted togo online. He was like, "Dude, I need tobuild a brand," and I was like, "Dude,you just need to start posting. You know,short form stuff, making stuff that'svaluable." He posted every day for sixmonths, and then one video took off.

Then the next video took off, and thenext video took off, and then all ofa sudden, now he's making $100,000 amonth from the content that he wasmaking. He'd already been doing businessfor nine years, and then, all of a sudden, ittook off. He messaged me, and hewas like, "I’m super grateful that thatyou told me to do that." So he did theposts, and he did the reach outs. Whatended up happening is that earlier on, hewould have videos that wouldstart taking off. He would start doingreach outs, you'd start making sales, andthen you'd make some money.

Would slow down, and then all of a sudden,you get into scarcity mode. Once he waslike, "Oh shoot, there's no money coming in."There's no money coming in, and then youstart making content, start doing roadsagain, and you make money again. And hewas like, "Dude, how do I break the cycle?"What we did was shift what hewas focusing on because he was focusingon the sales he was making; he wasfocusing on the money he was makingrather than focusing on the process. Youare not successful in my eyes becausewhenever you see some outcome, you stopthe activities, which means you don’t

have the trait of consistency. I was like,"The reason you aren’t where you want tobe is because you can’t do thingsrepeatedly." And so most people can’t doone thing over and over again. You needto be able to do the doing withoutseeing the result of your doing. Youhave to keep doing it, and if you cankeep doing things independently, thisis both ways: if it goes really well, youkeep doing the thing that got you there;and if it’s not going well, yet youkeep doing the thing so that you getgood enough that one day it will.

That’s the shift that most people don’tMake, and I think that's why most peoplejust stick around. The reality is thatif you can commit to the actions, thebehaviors, and the traits that you willgrow through doing, then at the end ofthis process, a decade later, you will bethe type of person who can do somethingfor a long period of time and wait. Ipromise you that if you have that trait,money will never be a constraint in yourlife. This is from "Atomic Habits":every winner and every loser have thesamegoals. So when you measure yourself byhaving this external thing, peopleare like, "Set goals." Everyone wants to berich, everyone wants to have a six-pack.

Your goals don't make you unique; it'sthe activities that you do that make youunique. The goal of the winner is tocommit to the activities; the goal of theloser is to commit to the goal. Fifty-two percent ofeighteen-year-olds, high school seniors, thinkthey're going to be millionaires by twenty-five.The world is going to be shocked; many ofyou will fail, and that's because most ofyou have the same goal. Fifty percent of you thinkyou're going to be a millionaire, right?That's just math, but only a smallpercentage will succeed. Because if you want toTo be a millionaire, you're not going tofocus on making the million dollars;you're going to focus on the stuff thatmakes a million dollars. And so, when youcan divorce the activities from theoutcome, then you can focus on the doing,which, whether your income does this over

that period of time, your self-esteemremains the same because you're committedto what you can control. If you can makethat shift, it will change your life. So, Istarted making podcasts six years ago. Icommitted to that process when I signedon with a YouTube vendor a few yearsago. On the first call, I said I'd like tohave this channel be something in five toten years. I was like, "We'll look at itthen and see if it's worth continuingto do." I was like, "But I'm in for a decade."And he stopped me afterwards — he was like,"I've literally never had a client saythat to me, ever." He was like, "They're alllike, 'How can I get leads in the first 90days from YouTube?' and blah, blah,blah." I was like, "If we're makingprogress, I'm good. I will commit to that.

I think that if you can think that way,you will get what you want. And thenpeople will ask you a decade from now,"Man, how did you have this overnight? "Success and blah blah blah blah blah, andaren't you like, don't the followers andthe fans, like, how does it not get toyour head? And you're like, because it wasnever the goal. So, I feel just asgood at year one as I do at year eight,because the activities that I committedto remain the same. If you can thinkthat way and you can shift yourperspective, it will decrease your emotional ups and downs.

And I think we all need ways to decreaseour emotional ups and downs in the gameof business, because we need to havesecond lives and third lives and fourthlives. And the way to do that is to notput your life, your game-playing life, insomething that you can’t control, butto put all your game-playing life inthe things you can right now. We justcrossed our 400th episode. 400 episodes;like, if I did one a week, that’s 52, foureight—one a week for a year—that wouldbe eight years of doing that. If I had400 episodes, I'm at like year six. If youmake 400 long-form pieces of content, Iguarantee you that your following wouldbe bigger than it is today. Well, how longis that going to take? As long as ittakes, because the goal was never theThe outcome, the goal, was to do this thing.
