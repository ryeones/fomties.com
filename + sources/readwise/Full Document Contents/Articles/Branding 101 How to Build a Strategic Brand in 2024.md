## Full Document
What's up brand builders Stephen Houraghan 
here at BrandMasterAcademy.com and in this   video you're going to learn branding 101 how to 
build a strategic brand so you can understand the   machine that influences audiences to choose your 
business of your competitors again and again so   what exactly is branding well look it's a pretty 
broad question and when you sit down and think   of it there are many different perspectives on 
this a lot of different players with different   opinions and different positions on what branding 
actually is but when you strip away all of that   

complication and really think about what branding 
is it's about making a business more appealing   to a certain group of people than the competitors 
and the aim of the game here is to influence their   buying decision now a lot of people believe that 
branding is about how a brand looks you know the   the logo how it appears visually and for the most 
part the they are right to some extent but really   

that's only the tip of the iceberg beyond the 
iceberg below the surface you have a machine of   elements all working together to make up the brand 
if all you have is a logo if all you have are   the visuals then there's no mechanism behind that 
brand to make those connections with the audience   so to answer the question what is branding it's 
all about understanding exactly who that audience   is and then building a brand and an ecosystem 
around that to make that business more appealing   

to that group of people so why exactly is branding 
so important well think about the alternative for   a second you have a business and you want people 
to buy your stuff but in order for them to buy   your stuff you're going to have to influence 
them now if all you know about branding is that   you need a logo on a website and you go ahead 
and pay a designer to get that logo and to get   that website and you put that website out into the 
world what do you have to influence those people   

the Assumption there is that people are just 
going to come to your website and see that you   have a good looking brand you have a website copy 
telling them what you do and then they're just   going to hit that buy button but the reality is 
completely different there are so many businesses   vying for the attention of your audience and 
they're doing their very best to influence their   buying decision and they're not just using logos 
and websites they're digging deep to understand   

exactly who Their audience is how they tick you 
know what makes them tick what drives them what   motivates them what what what are their fears 
what is it that they really want to achieve and   what problems do they have that the business can 
solve once they understand all of that then they   can devise a plan of how they will communicate to 
them that will influence how they feel and think   about that brand which will ultimately influence 
their decision okay so what is the difference   between brand strategy and brand identity these 
are two terms that are often used synonymously or   

if people see these terms side by side they can't 
really differentiate between the two the brand   identity is the visual brand it's how the brand 
shows up in the world visually so we're talking   here about those visual assets we're talking about 
the logo the color palette the fonts the image   style you know everything that the brand uses 
to show up visually is the brand identity that's   how the brand is represented visually the brand 
strategy on the other hand is the plan behind the   

brand and how they're going to engage and resonate 
and connect with that audience again to ultimately   influence their decision now the brand identity 
will have an influence on the audience they will   see that identity and if the colors and the style 
match what they like it will draw them in but it   won't influence their buying decision just with 
the visuals behind those visuals there has to be   

some kind of strategy and some kind of messaging 
that's going to speak to who they are that's where   the brand strategy comes in within the brand 
strategy you understand who that audience is   you understand what the competitors are offering 
them and then you have a position in the market   that's different from those competitors and 
that difference is going to offer your audience   an alternative to what's already out there in 
the market and with that difference with that   understanding of what you do and the value you're 
going to bring to the table it's going to help   

them to make their decision with that position 
you need to communicate that position well and   you do that through your messaging strategy you 
do that through your your storytelling and you   also do that through your brand personality 
they are the characteristics that you use the   traits that you use the verbal identity how you're 
going to speak to your audience are you going to   be cheeky are you going to be fun are you going 
to be formal or authoritative what is it that's   going to draw them in to help them to choose you 
over your competitors all of these elements come   

together in the brand strategy and that is the 
makeup of the strategy and on the front lines of   that is the visual identity so they work hand in 
hand together to ultimately influence the audience   the perception they have of the brand and their 
buying decision now behind every successful brand   are a set of familiar fundamental pillars that 
provides the foundation for that brand to grow   so let's dive into each one of these pillars first 
up is the brand DNA now within the brand DNA you   

have a few key ingredients here you've got your 
purpose your vision your mission and your values   now this is probably the most common common area 
of branding the people are aware of before they   get into positioning and differentiation and 
personality they will probably come across   these elements first and foremost and they tend 
to be overlooked a little bit in terms of their   importance people put together a purpose statement 
a vision statement a mission statement some values   and then they don't know how to communicate them 
but communicating them is not the name of the game   

the brand DNA is about who the brand is internally 
and it's there to guide decisions and actions as   to where that brand is going where they're going 
in the future what are they committed to in order   to achieve their vision for the future what 
do they hold dear in the way they do business   through their values these are all internal guide 
posts to help the brand make the right decisions   so that the brand stays on track it stays on brand 
in terms of where the leaders want that brand to   

go and what perception they want to create in 
the market so it's really important to have the   Brandy and a first and foremost the leadership 
team and everybody within the brand knows where   they're going next up is the target audience now 
I have seen this mistake time and again Business   Leaders they come to the table with a business 
plan and they have an idea for a product or a   service but they really haven't taken the time 
to consider exactly who they're trying to help   

they know there's a market out there for their 
products and their services but every Market is   broken up into segments and if you turn up with a 
product or service to the market that is meant for   the entire Market most likely you're going to miss 
out on pretty much all of those segments because   you're not relevant enough to those segments so 
think of your Market as a pie now if you turn up   to the market and you try to appeal to that whole 
pie then chances are you're not going to be able   

to do that if on the other hand you segment or you 
slice up that pie and you hone in on a particular   slice then you can identify what differences 
those people have within that segment to the   rest of the market and when you understand that 
when you understand those differences when you   understand what makes them tick then you can 
appeal to them more specifically so this is   without a doubt one of the most important aspects 
in the whole spectrum of branding and marketing is   

getting clear on exactly what segment of the 
market you want to Target so you can appeal   to them more specifically and be more relevant to 
who they are next up is your positioning strategy   now again going back to the leader going into 
the market for the first time having a product   and a service that the market wants is great but 
if your product and service is the exact same as   everybody else in the market first of all you're 
at a disadvantage because those are the players   

in the market already have that awareness they 
already have a head start on you so you're not   giving your audience anything to really choose you 
over them so you're at a complete disadvantage if   you just have the same as everybody else so what 
you need to do is you need to understand what   your competitors are offering your audience and 
then look for gaps and opportunities as to what   the audience wants and what they're not getting 
from your competitors in the market and that's   where your opportunity for your positioning 
strategy lies and your differentiation in   

the market so this is really about showing up to 
the market with something different to offer an   alternative to what's already out there and look 
this doesn't necessarily need to be disruptive   you don't need to be an Uber going into the market 
disrupting the the taxi industry it just needs to   be something slightly different maybe it's the 
way you provide your services maybe it's done   with you instead of done for you maybe there's 
a an element of convenience to it maybe there's   something along the brand experience that's a 
little bit different to what your competitors   

are offering but this is really really important 
to show up to the market not just with the same   as everybody else not the same price products in 
the same Services targeting the same people Target   someone different Target a specific segment of the 
market and give them within the market something   different than your competitors are offering and 
they will turn their attention towards you the   next pillar is your brand personality now showing 
up to the market with a great visual brand is a   

really good way to get some attention to get 
some visual attention but let's say for example   you have a beautiful looking website you have 
a beautiful logo and then your audience turns   up to your side and your website copy is Bland 
and it's dry and there's there's nothing really   there to draw your audience in you're speaking in 
corporate tones it's very very easy to lose the   attention of modern consumers today because quite 
frankly you know this yourself we don't have a lot   

of attention to give other people or other brands 
and we really need to feel drawn in to give our   attention and brand personality is a great way 
to do that and this goes back to understanding   who your audience is not just what they want not 
just their desires and their fears but also what   is their personality what traits do they have 
what is it that they're trying to achieve in   life are they you know chilled out do they have a 
connection with the Earth are they driven are they   full of energy do they want to save the world are 
they authoritative do they have a desire to have   

a high status in society what is it that drives 
them and what are their personal quality traits   when you really understand that you can understand 
how to show up with your brand and archetypes are   a very very good foundation for you to build your 
brand personality with if you don't know what   archetypes are I have a video on brand archetypes 
I'll leave that in the description but it's about   understanding the personality of your audience 
and then really putting together a personality   

that's going to appeal to who they are and using 
traits within how you communicate and not just   your visuals here but your messaging as well what 
tone of voice are you going to use what traits are   you going to use within your communication within 
your writing and that will really help to draw in   your audience because you're showing up to the 
market with a bit of personality and something   different to what's already out there the next 
pillar is your verbal identity now I touched   on this with the brand personality and verbal 
identity is essentially an extension of your   

brand personality it's the way your brand speaks 
in the market how it it talks the language that   it used the the the tone of voice it's going to 
use so you know are you going to show up with you   know rough language rugged language are you going 
to be a little bit edgy or are you going to show   up a little bit more relaxed more eco-friendly 
a little bit more soft in how you communicate   with your audience so there's a lot of scope for 
differentiation here just within your your verbal   

identity alone so really thinking about you know 
how we are as people how we connect with other   people and the people that you like within your 
lives you know do you tend to have a group of   friends that are energetic and a little bit more 
edgy and you know use bad language or do you tend   to gravitate more towards people who are kind of 
laid back and you know speaking soft tones so just   

understanding this alone about yourself and your 
own life and the the people that you're attracted   to will help you to understand how brands use 
verbal identity and again this this goes back to   who your audience is who you're trying to connect 
with who you're trying to appeal to but as I said   there's a lot of scope for differentiation 
within your verbal identity but it's really   understanding the role that you're going to 
play in the market who your audience is and   the way you're going to resonate with them next 
up is your brand messaging now this is probably   the one of the most impactful tools of influence 
that any brand has and it probably overlooked more   

than not by brand leaders who go into the market 
trying to build a brand they put all this focus on   how the brand looks you know the logo the website 
how they're appearing in the market and they put   very little emphasis on the messaging that they're 
going to put out there in the market now I'm not   just talking about copywriting here copywriting 
on your website this is the whole spectrum of   communication within your brand you know you need 
to Define exactly what you want to say to your   

audience what's important to your audience when 
it comes to choosing a brand when it comes to over   coming the problem that they have what is it that 
they're they're looking for and what signals will   provide them with the idea that you have what they 
need so your brand messaging is super important in   determining exactly what you want to say to your 
audience and how you're going to distribute those   messages across channels now again this goes 
hand in hand with your brand personality the   

messages that you put out there into the market 
is what you're going to say and the personality   and the verbal identity is how you're going to 
say them so understanding what you want to say   is super critical in influencing how your audience 
perceives your brand the next pillar is your story   now your Brand Story can come in different forms 
of course you have the Founder's story so who the   founder is where they've come from where they're 
going to now in all honesty your audience is not   

too interested in who the founder is now that will 
probably crush a few egos here but really building   a brand is not about you it's all all about 
your audience the story that your brand needs   to be telling or certainly needs to be focusing 
on is the story of your audience now you can do   this in many different ways you can look at past 
clients or past customers that have been through   the process that you provide and document 
that document that through case studies and   testimonials so that they can tell their story 
that will resonate with your future audience   

or with your future customers but this is really 
about resonating and connecting we're all drawn   in to stories we certainly remember stories a lot 
more than we remember facts and if you're able to   make that emotional connection and if you're able 
to tell a story that kind of aligns with who your   audience is the journey that they're on where 
they're coming from where they're going to the   challenges that they're having along the way 
they're the kinds of stories that draw Us in   

and if you think about this yourself when you sit 
down to read a story and there are many different   characters within the story you tend to take the 
a position of the protagonist within the story   and you tend to follow their journey and that's 
exactly what we want to do with our audience we   want to tell that story and if your story is 
super aligned with the journey that they're   on they're going to be drawn in so thinking about 
exactly what you do as a brand where you've come   from where you're going is is great but when you 
really nail down your audience and their story and   

you weave that in to the stories that you tell 
and the messages that you put out there in the   market then you're really going to draw your 
audience in because you will confirm to your   audience that you understand their Journey what 
they're going through where they're going and   what they're trying to achieve and then of course 
you have your brand name and your tagline now this   might seem strange that it's so far along and we 
haven't mentioned this before but really if you   think about it your brand name and your tagline 
is a strategic tool it tells your audience who   

you are and what you're about and if you do this 
early on in the process then you're not going to   have the added advantage of knowing the position 
that you want to take in the market the difference   you're going to offer the personality that you're 
going to show up with and the messages that you're   putting out there into the market when you have 
that information putting together a brand name   and a tagline is far more effective because it's 
helping you solidify that position it's helping   you to communicate to your audience exactly how 
you're going to help them and what you're all   

about so this is a really really important part 
of branding and you know it tends to be kind of   tacked on to services that are out there but in my 
opinion this is probably one of the most important   aspects in the whole spectrum of branding because 
when people see your brand name and they see your   tagline you know you think about how many people 
will see that and if you're able to throw a hook   out with that brand name and that tagline and it 
resonates with them quickly it tells them quickly   

what you're about and what you can potentially do 
for them that will help them to bring them into   your world so really Define finding a brand name 
that is aligned with your position in the market   and the position that you're trying to own and 
the message that you're trying to get across to   your audience is really important if you do this 
too early in the process you're going to miss that   opportunity and unfortunately that's how most 
brand names are created they're created by the   business owner before considering the strategy but 
the right way to do it is to consider the strategy   

then develop the brand name And the tagline and 
last but not least you have your visual identity   now we're getting to the visual identity at Point 
number nine when a lot of people believe when they   think about a brand or building a brand this is 
the first point that they will look towards to   build their brand but really think about all the 
elements that we have considered up until this   point we've considered who the audience is we've 
considered the competitors in the market how we're   positioned in the market the difference we're 
going to make the personality that we want to   

show up with what those traits are and the verbal 
identity within that personality as well and the   messages and stories that we want to send out into 
the market now think about all the tools we have   at our disposal to design the visual identity 
and think about the designer in this position   being able to reflect on the strategy and allowing 
that to guide their designs compared to a designer   who is sitting down with an open brief to design 
a visual identity for you know brand name X so   

designing the visual identity with the strategy 
in mind is the best way to do this because we   can really consider that personality and those 
traits and weave that in to the person into the   visualized identity that we are designing so again 
a really really crucial element in the brand when   we see the brand for the first time it has that 
immediate impact on us and there is no element   within the brand that is as impactful as that 
visual identity in that short space of time that   

we have to really draw our audience in so it's 
really really important but it's really brought   into the context of how important it is is really 
under the microscope when we consider the strategy   beforehand and we consider how that strategy can 
influence the design so now that we know all the   pillars what is the process in putting all this 
together in building the brand and building those   pillars and then getting that out there into the 
market well simply following those pillars that   

I've put forward which are in chronological order 
should be developed in that chronological order   the purpose the vision the mission the values 
understanding what's important to the business   leader where the brand is going and what they are 
committed to in the way they do business and then   looking into the market to who the audience is 
and what really they're trying to achieve and   what segment of the market you're going to Target 
because remember you can't Target the whole Market   or you're simply going to blend in you're not 
going to really appeal to those because you don't   

have enough specificity targeting a segment 
within the market gives you that opportunity   to to add specificity and then when you know that 
Target you want to go after you can look at who's   already serving that audience and what they're not 
doing well what gaps they're leaving in the market   that's where you find your positioning strategy 
that's where you find your difference and that's   where you're going to be able to add value to the 
market once you've done that once you've defined   your position then it's all about how are we going 
to show up in the market what's the personality   

we're going to lead with what are those traits 
and what are those verbal identity elements that   we'll use what are the traits that we're going 
to use when we speak to our audience then we move   into the messaging and the storytelling so we're 
understanding what we want to say to our audience   so that when we go out into the market and 
communicate with our audience we're influencing   their perception about what we mean in a strategic 
way instead of just blurting out anything that   we think they want to hear we have methodically 
sat down and understood what perception we want   

to have in the market and what messages we need 
to put into the market in order to achieve that   percent exception then we go into the visual 
Identity Design we get our designer on board   and we put that visual identity at there into the 
market now that is just building the brand that is   building the vehicle that is our brand that we're 
going to be able to use to communicate to the   audience then it's about your marketing strategy 
a lot of people think that the brand strategy and   the marketing strategy are running the same they 
are not now it's about understanding where your   

audience is congregating where are they online 
where are they physically and how are we going   to engage them on the front lines of the market 
what are they going to respond to and how are we   going to draw them in do we have a funnel are 
we going to guide them along every step of the   journey until they become a customer so thinking 
about all those different steps of the funnel all   those different potential channels and platforms 
that we can use to engage is super important in   

getting your brand out there into the market it's 
not just about building the vehicle it's about   understanding where that vehicle must go in order 
to appeal to your audience now look at the end of   the day as I said in the beginning branding is 
simply about making a business more appealing   to a certain group of people so that they choose 
that business over the other businesses that are   in the market offering similar products or 
services so really thinking about who your   audience is and what they're going to respond to I 
can't emphasize how important that is because your   

brand is not about you your brand is not for you 
your brand is owned by your audience because it's   a perception it's not a tangible thing it doesn't 
live on a billboard or a website or even in your   office it lives out there in the marketplace as a 
perception and all we can do as brand builders is   try to influence that perception as best we can 
so if you think about your brand and branding in   

those terms as something that is out there in 
the market that your audience is going to form   by themselves then we can think about how can 
we help them to form that perception and that   what is what branding is about at the end of the 
day it's about understanding that your brand is   a perception and all we have as brand builders is 
the ability to try and influence that perception   through our position through our differentiation 
through our personality our messages our stories   and our visual identity when you understand what 
branding is from that perspective you have the   

tools at your disposal to be able to influence 
your audience now if you want to dive deeper   into brand strategy then this video here will
