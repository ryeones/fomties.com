- Summary: Compound interest is the interest earned on both the original investment and the interest that has already accumulated. For example, if you invest $10,000 at a 5% interest rate, you earn more with compound interest over three years compared to simple interest. The difference grows larger over time, making compound interest very powerful for long-term savings.

savings account and a five percent simple interest rate for three years the interest you earn each year is 5% times ten thousand which equals five hundred dollars for a total of fifteen hundred dollars of interest at the end of year three five hundred dollars plus 500 plus five hundred now instead suppose that you deposit the same ten thousand dollars at 5% interest compounded annually in year one the interest you earn is the same five hundred dollars but in year two the 

interest you earn is 5% times ten thousand five hundred the original amount plus the interest you earned in year one so the second year's interest is five hundred twenty-five dollars in year three you earn five percent interest on eleven thousand twenty-five dollars ten thousand dollars plus five hundred year one interest plus five hundred 25 year two interest or an interest payment of five hundred fifty 

$1.25 in total you earn one thousand five hundred seventy six dollars and twenty five cents in interest over three years with compounding interest versus fifteen hundred dollars with simple interest a difference of seventy six dollars and twenty five cents the effective compounding becomes especially powerful over longer time periods as the amount of earned interest becomes larger and larger
