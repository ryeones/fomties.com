So I just got a fresh MacBook and this morning when I went to use it the trackpad would not click. It would not make the click noise when I pressed down on it. I shut the computer down and while it was powered off the trackpad would allow me to press down and would make the click noise. I googled how to fix this and nothing would work. So, I called Apple support. I powered the computer back on and he asked me to press and hold option+command+p+r and then power the computer off and back on. Once I did it the track pad would allow me to click again! I hope this helps someone‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎else!
