so we explored a little bit earlier on picking out some of our values and what resonates with us and our values really are a set of systems of belief of a deep core aspect of what we care about that sings without soul and that resonates with the person that we are the personhood that we have 

and as you've identified earlier in the eight forms of capital section perhaps it's now also time to see how some of your values can come alive in the daily awareness of your decision making so to thy own values be true why is this so important oftentimes in the hustle and bustle of life we are thrown into situations where 

we have to make decisions around money around family around relationships around work commitments and having our set of values in my case I value relationships and one of the values that I choose oftentimes is love so how do I operate with love putting the other before myself perhaps even in 

seeking to understand them as opposed to be understood a very simple but very difficult example of how to to be loving when it comes to money one of the key values that my husband and I really value is the value of freedom and this this is not just a exterior sense of Freedom where we can also choose how and where we spend our time 

and our money but it's also an interior Freedom knowing that when we put our money to work sometimes we get the opportunity to have time freed up so oftentimes when we make financial decisions we ask ourselves does this financial decision for instance like buying a house give me a greater sense of freedom to be closer to the goal of being debt free earlier 

um and that's sometimes making decisions like you know buying a three-room flat as opposed to buying 85 from a flat that's something that resonates for us in our family because we see that we would like to worry less about money and therefore this value of the values that we have in thinking about freedom and living out Freedom matters to us in other cases you know when we think 

about relationships that matter to us then when I think about you know some of my values in my family taking care of my family and in the relationships that I have then money becomes a tool to help me to take care and invest in relationships and that means you know taking my family and my friends out for a meal hosting them when they come over and these are things that money has worked for me and I put money to work 

that way because I value these aspects of my daily life so when it comes to you as you think about to their own values be true what are some of the values that you have that you've identified that you want to practice more in your daily life um it's an experiment so choose one or two that allows you to come to some awareness of what matters most to you
