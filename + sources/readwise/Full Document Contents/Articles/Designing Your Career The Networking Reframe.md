- Summary: Networking doesn't have to feel sleazy; it can be seen as asking for directions. Most people enjoy helping others, just like they would when giving directions. By reframing networking this way, you can become part of a community and help others in return.

## Full Document
What do you picture
when you think about "networking?" Many people think of slick, self-interested people manipulating others to get things they
don’t deserve, or pretending to
care about someone just to use them
to get to someone else. But what if instead
of considering networking sleazy, we reframed
the way you think of it, and reimagined it
as something else entirely? One way to reframe
networking is to 

picture it as asking
for directions. Think back on the
last time you lived or worked somewhere
where you really knew your way around. Can you remember a
time when a stranger came up and asked
you for directions? What happened? If you were able to point them in the
right direction, how did you feel? Did you feel like
they were using you? No! If you’re like most
people you felt good about being
able to help someone out. In general, just
like you’re happy to 

give directions to a
stranger, most people enjoy doing small things to help others. And asking for
help finding people or information in a professional context, is actually
a lot like asking where you can find
the nearest ATM or coffeehouse. Networking allows
people inside a community to help
people like you - who may be from
outside the community - find their way,
learn new things, and better participate
in a domain or type of work. And the community benefits from 

bringing new people into the conversation, too: the more
introductions that are made, the more information
everyone has to take advantage of. Good networking is
just like asking for directions, and people are happy to help. The point isn’t to "do" networking; the goal is to
become part of the network. And someday you’ll help someone too!
