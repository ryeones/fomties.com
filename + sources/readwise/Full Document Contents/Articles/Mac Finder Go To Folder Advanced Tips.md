## Full Document
Hi, this is Gary with MacMost.com. Let 
me show you some advanced tips for using   the Go To Folder command in the Mac Finder.
MacMost is brought to you thanks to a great   group of more than 2000 supporters. 
Go to MacMost.com/Patreon. There you   could read more about it. Join us and get 
exclusive content and course discounts. Now a Mac user can go their whole 
lives without ever using the Go To   Folder command. It's in the Go Menu and it's 
right here. It allows you to type to go to a   

specific folder instead of navigating 
around using your Mouse or a Trackpad. My first tip is that nobody ever uses it with 
the menu item. The whole point is to use the   keyboard to navigate around so you wouldn't 
want to start by using the Pointer to activate   it. Instead you want to use the keyboard 
shortcut. Shift Command G. So that's what   I'll do throughout this entire video. So Shift 
Command G will bring it up. Of course you have   to be using a Finder window for this to happen. 
It doesn't take you to the Finder automatically.   

But there are some other cases I'll talk about 
later where you can use this special command. Now how it works is pretty simple. You can type 
the path to a folder and then press Return and   it will jump to it. So, for instance, I have a 
folder called Projects in my Documents folder.   I can type the full path to it. So that would 
be /Users/macmost/Documents/Projects. Then if   I press Return you could see it jumps to that 
folder. But the whole point is to get somewhere   

fast which means typing a full path name, from the 
top level, doesn't make much sense. Fortunately,   you don't have to do that. You could start typing 
the name of a folder from the current location.   So I'm in my Documents folder here and I can 
see, for instance, there is a folder called   Notes. If I type Notes it will recognize that I'm 
already in my Documents folder and find the Notes   folder. Likewise, it will also look in the Home 
folder. So for instance in your Home folder you've   

got folders like Music, Pictures, Downloads, and 
such. I can start typing there. You'll see they   will have a section here called Go To Folder in 
Current Location and Go To and then it is going   to have your Home folder here. So you can very 
quickly get to this folder if it is in your Home   folder. You can click on it but you can also use 
the Down Arrow to get to it and then press Return.   Users of the Terminal will recognize also that 
you can use Shortcuts, like tilde, which is the   

key above the Tab key on US keyboards. You need 
to use Shift to use tilde and slash and now   indicate your Home folder. So you can see how 
it already includes the path to my Home folder   there. You could also use Period/ to represent 
the current folder, in this case Documents,   and then type there. Some people prefer to do 
that especially if you use the Terminal a lot. Now another way to speed things up is you 
can Auto-Complete using the Tab key. So,   for instance, I'm here in my Documents folder. 
Let's say I want to go to the folder named PDF   

Examples. You can see it here at the bottom. 
So I can start typing PDF Examples and as soon   as I type enough to make that the top choice 
there I can just press Tab and it will fill   the entire thing in. If it is ambiguous which 
one I mean, so I'll just type P here and there   are a bunch of folders that start with P. If 
I press Tab it will fill in the first one but   not Auto-Complete it. The second time I 
press Tab it will give me a system beep,   

so in other words telling me it still doesn't 
know which one I want. But if I do it a third   time it actually will do it. You could also just 
use the Down Arrow. So I can type P and then I   can use the Down Arrow to go to the one I want. 
Once I'm there pressing Tab will Auto-Complete.   Likewise using Tab to get to something, then 
Return, will actually just jump there. So if   I type P right here and I go down to Personal 
and press Return and it will jump right there.   

I didn't even have to Auto-Complete since 
I had selected it with the Down Arrow. Notice it also recognizes Recents here. You 
could just start typing something that is in   a Recent Folder there. So, for instance, 
I've got the Movies Folder which isn't in   my current location. I'm in Documents now. 
But if I start typing Movies it will pick   that out of the Recents and I can just 
press Return and it will jump there. Now if you want to access External Drives 
you can do that as well. I can do that by   explicitly typing slash and then Volumes and 
then slash and then start typing the name of   

the volume. So /Volumes/A for instance 
for Archive and there it is. I can tab   to Auto-Complete and then continue to search 
or I could have just hit Return to go to it.   But you don't typically need to actually type 
slash Volume. You could just type the name of   the Drive and if it is a recent place you've 
been to it should find it just with that name. One advantage to using Go To Folder is you can 
just as easily get to Hidden Folders as anywhere   

else. So, for instance, if I were to go to my 
Home folder here I won't see my Library Folder   there. It's there but it is hidden. I can get 
to it by going to the Go Menu and holding down   the Option Key and there it is. I can see that 
it is located in my Home Folder like that. But   I could also use Go To Folder and type this. You 
can see it will find it just like anything else. Now I know there are people that also 
like to get into Packages. Packages are   

basically folders that masquerade as files. 
They actually have a bunch of files in them.   For instance Libraries typically are packages. 
So you can get into this by using Control Click,   right click, or two-finger click on a trackpad, 
and then Show Package Contents. Once I'm in here,   for instance, I can see all the different 
iMovie projects. So here's one called Example,   for instance. My Path now includes getting 
into the Package. Well you can do the same   thing using Go To Folder without having to open 
the Package. So I can go back up to this level   

here and there's that iMovie Library. I can start 
typing and there's the iMovie Library there. I   can Auto-Complete it like that, type Slash, and 
I can actually look inside it. So there's that   folder inside the package and I can jump right 
to it. So a quick way to get into Package Files. Now I mentioned before that Go To Folder 
only works in the Finder but there is an   exception. That exception is Dialogue Boxes 
where you're asked to either Open, Save,   

or Export something to a location on your 
drive. These are basically like little mini   Finder windows. So, for instance, here I am in 
Pages. If I were to go to Save this document for   the first time using Command S or File Save, 
I'm now in a File Save Dialogue. You can use   Shift Command G to bring up the Go To Folder box 
here and type in it. So I can go to Documents,   

and say, Projects like that and then when I press 
Return it changes location to that location. Now   I can Save. The same thing is true when you 
go to Open a Document. Go To Open and I can   do Shift Command G and it brings up the Go To 
Folder box. It works when you Export too. So   I can select a few photos there. I can do File, 
Export, Export these photos. Select my options and   then I'm in the Export Dialogue here to choose a 
location. I can do Shift Command G there as well. 

You can actually use Go To Folder to Access Tags 
even though that really has nothing to do with   folders. So notice here I've got several different 
Tags. I can access those by typing the name of the   Tag. So I'll bring up the box and then I'll start 
typing the name of a tag. Like that. You'll see Go   To and then shows Tags and that Tag. When I select 
it it's the same as if I selected the Tag here   in the left Sidebar. But an advantage is that you 
can access tags that aren't in the Sidebar. Under   

All Tags I saw there was a Business Tag, for 
instance. That's not in the Sidebar here. So   I'll use Go To Folder and I'll type Business 
and there's the Business Tag. I can just use   the Down Arrow to go to it and Return and now I'm 
seeing all the files that have that Tag applied. Now you can actually do more than just change 
the location of a current Finder window with Go   To Folder. So let's go to Daily Reports. I'll 
Auto-Complete that and then Filed Reports and   

Auto-Complete that. Now, if I were to Press Return 
it would simply take me to that Folder change of   location. However, if instead I hold the Command 
Key down and Press Return it opens up a new Tab,   leaving that previous location in another Tab, 
like that. Now this only happens if, in Finder,   Settings, you've got under General, Open Folders 
in Tabs instead of new windows. Now I can also   

Open up a New Window using the same command but 
this time I'm going to do Option and Command and   then Return. Now I get a second window leaving 
that original window untouched. There's one more.   If you instead hold Shift Command and then Press 
Return or click you will open up the Terminal App   and go directly to this location. So you can see 
that I'm located there in the new terminal window. 

Now notice how I Auto-Completed Daily 
Reports and Filed Reports by typing the   first few letters of each. You can do that. 
But you can also can take the first letter   of each word. This is an interesting trick. 
You've got d and r for Daily Reports and f   and r for Filed Reports. Watch what happens 
if I type d r . It recognizes Daily Reports   and even Bolds those two letters there. It 
even finds some other things. Developer has d   and it ends with an r and Doc Folders has 
d and it's got an r towards the end there.   

These should be things either in your Current 
Location or Recent Finds. So I can now tap Tab   to Auto-Complete that and type f r and it 
finds Filed Reports. Then to Auto-Complete   that. So you can use long folder names with lots 
of words, be really descriptive, and know that in   Go To Folder you can easily access them by 
just typing the first letter of each word. Now one of the things about using this is that if 
I were to use it right now I'd end up inside of   

Filed Reports.What if I wanted to actually go to 
the folder above it but have Filed Reports just   the highlighted or selected folder. You can do 
that but you have to use your mouse or trackpad.   You need that to bring up the Context Menu with a 
right click or Control Click or two-finger click   on a trackpad. If you do that then you have Show 
In Enclosing Folder. You do that and now you get   the Enclosing Folder shown in the folder that was 
indicated there, that is selected. Note that it   

depends where you click. If I were to do that 
here in Daily Reports and Show Enclosing Folder   then it is actually going to go to the Documents 
folder and select Daily Reports. So it's reacting   to the actual thing you're clicking on here. Do 
it for the last one if that is what you want. Now sometimes you can actually use Go To 
Folder to go to a File. So, for instance   here in the Business Folder I've got a bunch of 
different files. I've got a bunch of them named   Project Report, for instance. Some text files, 
some PDF files and things like that. So I can   

use Go To Folder then I can start typing 
Business here and Auto-Complete that. Do   a slash and now if I typed P, for project 
reports, notice it does bring up Files. So,   I can now go down and select one of these files. 
If I press Return at this point what happens is it   goes to that folder and had that file selected. 
So it doesn't actually open the file. Just goes   

to it and shows it to you. But you can Control 
Click, two-finger click or right click on this   and choose Open if you want. Although it is just 
as easy to go to it and then do Command O on   the keyboard and it will open it up so you don't 
have to use your mouse or trackpad to get there. So if you like using the Go To 
Folder command in the Finder or   you're just discovering it now for the first time,   there are a bunch of Advance Tips to help 
you make the most of it. Thanks for watching.
