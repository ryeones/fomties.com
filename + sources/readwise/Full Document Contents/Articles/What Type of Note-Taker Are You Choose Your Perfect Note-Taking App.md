it seems like productivity apps are multiplying like flies and with so many options how do we choose a note taking app to reduce stress and unlock creativity to gain a competitive Advantage we helping thousands of people build extended brains what I call a system of digital tools to navigate the internet learn and create our best work I've realized that most of us approach choosing a Notes app completely wrong our Notes app is the central piece of our extended brain and I know how easy it is to get distracted by these brand new features and hype but we can have the most advanced toys and none of the result results if we don't understand 

why they're useful think of it like deciding on what kind of car to drive of course the first filter we go through is that the car has to meet our minimum standards of functionality right like a 1950s gas guzzling hunk of metal it probably doesn't make sense in 2024 right we need some quality control but once we do have that then all cars pretty much do the same thing of getting you from point A to point B now it's up to preference and style you wouldn't want a Prius if you go off-roading a lot and you wouldn't want a Ferrari if you have four kids in a newborn right well 

maybe this is the same approach we should take for building our extended brain so to understand why I'm going to recommend these no taking apps let me first share my musthave features list number one is tagging and relational linking we want to be able to link our pages together to form a network of ideas this is super useful for organizing things in our mind so we can quickly find whatever we need to number two is accessibility IOS app must desktop apps must browser version collaboration you know the deal we need to be able to access our notes at any time anywhere number three is quick 

capture we want to easily be able to capture things from the internet anywhere into our extended brain Notes app and this includes written text images video audio memos booknotes highlights and everything else and number four which is kind of underrated is the culture of the app itself is there a lot of help and support do they have a big Reddit Community how is the community itself are the people nice are they willing to share information because even if you are tech savvy there are going to be times when you need help and support and if it's hard to find or it doesn't exist not a really great app number five Integrations with other apps 

and ai ai is the future and with advances in apps AI can enhance our notes to think analyze and synthesize ideas between what we already know and form connections we never thought even possible so if the app doesn't have native or at least strong Integrations with AI I won't even consider it so based on these criteria I've narrowed down hundreds of apps to this small list here on the right these are the ones that are more suited for power users and on the left side easier clean simple to use ones as you can see picking a Notes app is much more manageable after this 

first filter now let's put it through our second filter which is matching it to our learning style and in order to do that we have to identify a brain type so according to preliminary science there are three distinct brain types these vary on a spectrum of sensitivity on one end we have the resistant types which we call kumas they prefer stability routines and comfort then we have operator types which are called toras they prefer structure and clear goals and finally on the other end of the spectrum we have the adaptable types which we call kitsunes they prefer 

flexibility and technical details we've compiled all the research into a quick quiz to identify your brain type and I'm going to leave a link below it's free to take and reflect on but based on over 35,000 people in our community who have taken this quiz this is the breakdown of the learner types we've discovered 20% of our community are kumas or the stability types kumas prefer reliability Simplicity and familiarity in their Learning System they like to Deep dive and explore the most useful things and they're often looking for the most 

practical knowledge insights they like collecting and categorizing ideas combining old and new stuff now if you're a Kuma you might be somewhat of a deep researcher You' like to take your time you like to learn deeply and immerse yourself in few projects in your studies if I were to give my recommendations for kumas the best ones would be Apple notes and notion these note taking tools are simple they're aesthetically pleasing they're very reliable and they have this almost intuitive and comforting vibe to them like you already know how to use them before you even sit down and use them even though they don't see seem like it 

both of these tools have really powerful folder organization and structure that are helpful for project focused work as well as going deep with your learning so next up 30% of our community are toras or operator types toras prefer structure organization and clear objectives for their Learning System taures are planners goal Setters and like to strategize they focus on practicality and function as well as Aesthetics just to keep things very organized so if you like to strategize you like figuring things out you like watching and making progress in your work work and that 

energizes you you might be a Torah for which tools are best for Tores I would definitely recommend tana and notion these are really powerful note-taking tools and can double up as project management tools since Tores really like structure and clear goals these tools can have unique dashboards that make them super collaboration friendly these apps can be very visually pleasing and structured so you can build a dream note- taking and learning workflow that also doubles as a project management dashboard and finally 50% of our community are kitsunes these are 

adaptable creative types kitsunes are very technical and they have a very chaotic organizational style they love having customization and they tend to just learn by following their curiosity and they're very spontaneous with things right new ideas come they write it down they might move on they usually have multiple interests and multiple projects always going on and they bounce back and forth between them because their mind tends to wander a lot and because of that you know their daydreamers they're very imaginative and they learn very quickly but also forget very quickly they like to think tank you know they need time to cook and they're always 

trying to create new ideas even if they don't actually know where those ideas are headed so if I were to give my recommendations for which apps are most suitable for kitsunes it would be obsidian or Tana these apps are modern with a slightly steeper learning curve but have far more flexibility and customization and they can have workflows that are really chaotic yet organized because everything can be linked together it can be tagged and it can be resurfaced at any time but if you are a katune and you're not interested in like a really power feature workflow then I also would would recommend notion 

it's a lot simpler it's still versatile and it can create whatever kind of structure you want so I would just take a moment now did any of those descriptions I talked about instantly Vibe with you do you see yourself normally as someone more structured or someone more spontaneous are you a power user who builds customized workflows or do you really just want something simple and reliable over anything else now it's important to remember that there's no right or wrong choice here right all these apps are great and this is of course is just my opinion and it's up to you to EXP experiment with this at the 

end of the day because your extended brain is yours right it's personal and it might even make sense for you to use multiple of these apps simultaneously for example my learning style is a blend of Kitsune and Torah I lean more Kitsune but I do have a lot of Torah Tendencies as well so the apps that I personally use every day are Tana for personal Knowledge Management and notion for organizing collaborating and managing my business and my team but that took a long time for me to arrive at I tried a whole bunch of tools in the meantime and 

who knows it might change again once things update or I discover a different workflow that I want to explore and so to escape from analysis paralysis I would say just commit to an app right now you know play around with it for a few weeks even a few months and you can always course correct or change direction in the future but once you have decided on which not ticking app you want to serve as the core of your extended brain what should it be able to do well if you want to behind the scenes look into my notion workspace that I personally use then check out this video over here it's going to answer all of your questions
