Finally!

🐺 <https://ncase.me/anxiety/>  🐺  

 😱 free, web, 30 min playtime  😱

And if you (or someone you know) is struggling, and looking to tame 
 that wolf – I've also written a "companion piece" for this game, with [Mental Health Tips & Resources + a personal story of my own mental health journey](https://ncase.me/mental-health/)!

I sincerely hope this story-game is helpful to you and/or folks close
 to you. To whoever you are: you're not alone in this, stay determined, 
 good luck. 💖

AAAHHHH,
