- Summary: The iOS Shortcut discussed helps capture various types of media into a daily log file efficiently. It focuses on creating 'weather resistant' notes that can withstand time and changes in technology. By using plain text and linking directly to files, the shortcut ensures the data's portability across different applications.

*Cultivate ‚Äòweather resistant‚Äô notes in a frictionless fashion using iOS Shortcuts.*

It has been almost two years since I wrote a brief post on an iOS Shortcut that does one thing, and just one thing well: efficiently capture plain text and append it to a daily log file.

To my surprise, I still use this shortcut many times a day. Correction: I now use an *enhanced* version of this shortcut.

It is able capture almost *any* type of media to my daily log including plain text in as frictionless of a way as possible. Despite its generality, I find it is most useful to cultivate what I call ‚Äòweather resistant‚Äô media: capture and revisit data in formats that are likely to weather the rise and fall of new and shiny apps as well as withstand the test of time:

* plain text (eg. `.txt`, `.html`, `.md` )
* images (eg. `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`)
* audio/video (eg. `.mp4`, `.wav`, `.mov`)
* PDF

There aren‚Äôt many ‚Äòweather resistant‚Äô formats, and since they have stood the test of time, there are many tools to process these formats directly in very useful ways. Even the latest AI tools work best when provided lots of data in these basic formats. For example, apps like rewind.ai literally capture your screen and audio to help you automatically search and summarize your data.

Beyond useful search and summarization is the more hands-on task of cultivation of your media. For me, a ‚Äòfiles and folders‚Äô approach has proven to be the most trustworthy way of revisiting and processing my notes over time. I don‚Äôt have to worry about whether I‚Äôve captured something in Apple Notes, or Todoist, or Notion or ‚Ä¶ whatever. Everything is captured as weather resistant files by default into my daily log.

Applications like Drafts or Apple Notes excel at frictionless media capture at the cost of some form of lock-in. Even if it is possible to export your data into a more portable format, this process does not come without considerable headache in my experience and threatens the utility of long-term cultivation of personal knowledge. The beauty of capturing media in plain text linked directly to files is that this data is readily useful across many different types of applications (eg. Obsidian, iA Writer, file browsers, terminals, Dropbox for backup and cloud-based OCR, etc.).

iOS Shortcuts is what enables the capture of this data to be frictionless. The capture is performed local to the files on the phone and uses iOS native features so it is very fast and, crucially, *not dependent on any other application*. I happen to use my data a lot with Obsidian, but there is absolutely nothing restricting me to Obsidian.

Here is an example of how, by default, the shortcut uses plain text as an input. I have mapped this shortcut to my ‚Äòaction button‚Äô on the iPhone for super fast input. It‚Äôs an iOS pop-up inviting a quick note perhaps with a URL and then gets out of your way so you can move on with life. No opening another app. No switching back-and-forth between open apps.

The enhanced version of the shortcut also allows this type of efficient capture for sharing any type of media including marked up photos or files. For example, here‚Äôs a marked up screenshot that will be saved into my daily log attachments folder:

From here, it is easy to perform shares of many images from the ‚ÄòPhotos app‚Äô or any app where you can select media to share. (To enable this type of capture, you need to allow your shortcut to be run in an iOS ‚Äòshare sheet‚Äô. This is very simple and explained in a link below.) Below is an example name of the file in a simple year, month, day, time-of-day format.

Here is the [link to my shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/7483f39dad0547d3853f53ca20e782d6) so that you can modify it for your purposes. The language is a little odd (eg. it is like a full fledged programming language with loops and variables, but doesn‚Äôt support ‚Äòor‚Äô statements directly in conditionals). The shortcut will therefore likely be refined over time. Feel free to comment or ping me directly with any questions!
