few to describe the island of Penang 80% of the population lives in high-rise housing people on Penang Island consumes 362 million litres of water each day that is enough water to fill 150 Olympic sized swimming pool and we're talking just one day since the year 2000 the 

total growth of Penang Island due to land reclamation project is 4.1 square kilometre well grown bigger in land size at least by 1% in the last 15 years and I think you agree with me we keep on saying that Penang traffic is horrendous the number of registered vehicles per person aged 15 and above is an amazing 

1.9 I am guilty I have one motorbike and truly cars at home and do you know Time magazine ranked Penang on the list of top selfie taking cities in the world hang on so don't be surprised you will 

see people smiling on your phone on the street well numbers are fun they don't always connect to people I wanted to see the faces behind some of these numbers some time ago we reviewed the most recent census and some up-to-date population estimates we broke it down into five categories namely age gender 

neighborhoods family composition and ethnicity you can find them in the program booklet on pages 13 to 15 take me for an example if you turn to page 13 if you have them I am from team Ola like 72% of the people living in Penang I am 

a female like 51% of the penang guys i am married like 43 percent of the people i'm in each category 50 to 59 and I'm one of the 53% Chinese using a five categories he wanted to bring together 100 people to represent 

our city which was the hardest category to find Mary Chinese woman each category 3249 we sampled it wasn't easy using the snow bomb mythology to get the hundred people to represent Penang and put them on stage today I had the task to find the next person and I nominated my mother her demographic profile is women

who are you was born and bred in Penang [Music] I wasn't that's why I'm here standing here in the side tonight I was born and bred in Australia and as a military 

family we were posted to a different Air Force phone base every two to three years so I moved around a lot with my family now my question to you is who still lives in the house where they grew up 

okay and a tank of Filipino and oh when you dropped by gooble son politic [Applause] 

who came here by bus I didn't come here by bus because if I did I'd be late or I think I'd be late who still shops in who on the streets I 

mean sorry who shops and shopping malls rather than on possum olives and all that stuff I often chop in shopping malls because supremo's are more convenient lots of parking and of course air-conditioning nowadays you don't see that many people 

are on the streets because we see a lot of cars and of course we see a lot of tourists it in Penang is all very tourists I do I think tourism in Penang is booming but possibly potentially strategize to promote tourists with higher spending 

power majority of them don't spend enough and mainly there are European backpackers who don't really contribute to our local economy the next question is who of you here knows someone who is homeless well I do know someone who was homeless she was a 16 year old girl and because she was in a relationship with a boyfriend at a young age her mother didn't like it and tell her to go out 

the house so she was actually homeless for a while until her boyfriend took her in it's sad but she has she can actually speak four languages also wondering who over here can speak more than five languages I by a haka in weimar Josie Hokkien long mahai para para dancer saga sorry blogger that is Cola come on son 

what's up intern kako Marcos is who thinks the government knows too much about them I think that the government knows too much about us because we voluntarily posts about our lives online I know that because I used social media a lot so but 

that doesn't mean that our information should be used against us our freedom of expression needs to be preserved so who among us things that the Sedition Act should be abolished [Applause] 

the Sedition Act dates back to the British colonial times it is often used to stop freedom of speech of the civil societies the people and some politicians I am a journalist it is hard for us to write about politics sometimes by the write about human stories for example about babies that are killed by their own mothers because of stigma hooting sex before marriage is OK 

who liked kissing in public to be legalized 

I do not all the mushy mushy in public is looks to me keep that in part keep them private sabayon video player on Harris deepen our kind 

[Applause] prostitution should be legalized to safeguard the lives of the women and also to monitor the acts of sexual predators sabaki Alalu purgative must agree otoko 

[Music] shikaka dental and yep Jia Bao would unit one I consider myself agnostic which means 

that I do think that there's something out there but I'm very based in science who here believes in extraterrestrials who believes that capitalism works for them 

Karl Marx predicted that World War three will begin due to capitalism now who can imagine being the mayor of Penang [Applause] 

who is studying or has studied in a private school or university 

which of you has the right to vote I voted for the first time in 2013 because I want a change so for those of you who have the right to vote who actually voted in the last elections 

[Applause] so non-voters sit down on the stairs since you don't work please have a seat all right ello look my only tailors you look ok my mind ok now look at what we 

the voters would do to your future hooting we should open our country for refugees
