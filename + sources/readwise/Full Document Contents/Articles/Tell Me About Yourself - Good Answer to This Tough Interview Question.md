hey everyone I'm Jeff and this is my friend Mike 
and we are known as the interview guys and today   we're coming to you live from a deserted island 
Hey look Jeff a message has come for you in that   bottle yeah I already read it Mike and it says 
you're a tool anyway today we're gonna look at   the question tell me about yourself uh thanks 
for that Jeff anyway as you know this is one of   the most commonly asked job interview questions 
and if you don't know what you're doing it can   also be one of the toughest so don't worry folks 
because the interview guys are here to help thanks   

captain cheesy okay so let's get started let's 
imagine that Jeff was at an interview so Jeff   why don't you start by telling me about yourself 
well I'm from Seattle Washington I enjoy mountain   biking and cooking and my favorite color is sorry 
Jeff that is not the way to answer that question   let's take a look at where you went wrong okay 
so there's three main points that you need to   remember when answering this question what's the 
first one Jeff well as you saw in my bad answer   you absolutely do not want to go on and on about 
your personal life or hobbies and interests which   

leads me to point number two I want to include 
specific work achievements from your past and   your answer but there's one final trick isn't 
there Jeff that's right Mike it is always a good   idea to mention your strengths and abilities and 
your answer okay Jeff well let's give you another   shot at it so Jeff why didn't you start by telling 
me about yourself well I've been in sales for the   last five years my most recent experience was in 
the retail industry where I was a manager at the   comfy shoe company I was personally responsible 
for a 30% increase in sales over the last year   

I'd say that my main strength is my leadership 
ability which was evident in the way I'm entered   my sales team to reach our lofty goals what I'm 
looking for is a company that values teamwork and   the group dynamic where I can join a strong team 
and have a positive impact on the team dynamic   and sales revenue outstanding work Jeffery way to 
use the three points we talked about effectively   so did you see the difference the first time 
I answered I gave a wishy-washy response that   would have taken me out of the running right 
away then the second answer you mentioned an   achievement and backed it up with one of your 
strengths and how it would help you in your   

new role good job thanks Mike but we're not out 
of the woods yet are we there is one more thing   that all the top job seekers in the world do and 
that 99% of people screw up millions of people   are failing to do this and as a result they're 
not getting jobs and you probably didn't notice   this but in my second answer I said something 
that would have sealed the deal and got me the   job Jeff is right we like to call it Taylor and it 
is the method used by all the top job seekers in   the world as we always say you need to tailor your 
answers to the company your interview with you see   

each company is looking for some specific traits 
and you have to make sure you demonstrate in your   answers that you have those traits now this is an 
incredibly powerful method that lets you zero in   on exactly what the company is looking for now 
there's a lot more to the tailoring method than   we have time to go over in this video but don't 
worry because we've got a free special report   for you that breaks down the entire methods step 
by step we're Jeff and Mike the interview guys   and thanks for watching now click the button that
