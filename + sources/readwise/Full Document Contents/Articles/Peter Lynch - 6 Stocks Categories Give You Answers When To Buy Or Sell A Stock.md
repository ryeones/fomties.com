## Full Document
Today, fellow investors, thank you forcommenting your ideas and your greatbusinesses in yesterday's video.Today, we're going to categorize thosestocks into the six categories Lynchfinds crucial when it comes to investing,so that you can attach a story to theinvestment idea you have and then seeall the characteristics of those stories.

So let me first discuss the stories,and then I will comment on a few stocks thatyou mentioned in yesterday's comments.We have slow growers, stalwarts, fastgrowers, turnarounds, cyclical, and assetplays. Those are the six investmentcategories that Peter Lynch puts a stockinto, and each has specificcharacteristics. You have to see which stocks fit where.

Remember, stocksalways evolve over time, always change. Soone stock over 20, 40 years can bein each category. That's something tokeep in mind.

Investing is always dynamic. Before justgoing into the categories, Peter Lynchsays big companies, small moves.Coca-Cola was a great company; it is a greatcompany, but over the last 22 years, it'sup just 36%. It has globalized andis growing its earnings.

Dividends are important, but it's also about valuation,and then it's also about how big thecompany already is to grow more into thefuture. It's also a concept that Lynchdiscusses: diversification. When a companystarts investing in unwise ventures withlower returns on capital just to chasegrowth that isn't coming from themain product, you see brands like Coca-Cola Zero,healthy green options, etc. So let’s go intothe categories. Number one: slow growers.

Keep in mind that fast growers can turninto slow growers at some point in time. Arecent example is Apple. Apple and IBMare discussed in the book as fastgrowers. IBM became a slow grower muchearlier than Apple, but sooner or later,all stocks hit the upper limit andbecome slow growers. So, extremely fastgrowth followed the introduction of theiPhone for Apple, and over the lastfive years,there's been veryslow growth in revenues.

What are the characteristics of slow growers?Flat charts, flat earnings, and therefore aflat stock chart. But they can move onvaluation, as we have seen Apple do.Generous and regular dividends, Apple'sdividend and buyback payout is veryLarge compared to earnings, so they arenot investing in new things, andtherefore, you have to check the dividendsafety. Low payout gives a caution thatthe dividend will continue to be paidout. High payout makes it risky becauseyou can have the coronavirus hittingApple's revenues and then lowering itsdividend and buybacks. So, growers are notbuyable for Lynch because Lynch is lookingfor better companies. Slow growers arefor those that want safety or perceivedsafety because when things turn out forslow growers, and we have seen manycompanies really drop, drop, drop despitethe good dividends, despite everything. So,Lynch says if there is a slow growerwith no perspectives to turn around toincrease growth, to do smart things, todiversify into new things, new products,and then you also have to see how muchis that new product significant for therevenues. It's a no investment for PeterLynch. The second category is stock stalwarts.

So, Peter Lynch discusses companiesthat grow faster than other companiesbetween 10 and 12 percent. This was inthe 1980s, so inflation was higher.Companies were naturally growing higher.We can now put it perhaps between 6 andTwelve percent, which are good growth rates,but those are companies that, okay, canexpand their business. But you can’t expect miracles from there, so itis about valuation. And then if a companygoes stale, the word goes up 50, 80, 100%. Youmight think about selling it and buyingsomething that's more undervaluedbecause the spike in the pricedoesn't justify the earnings growth. Forexample, Bristol-Myers is a company thatgrew 10% since 2014.

Okay, that's good. The earnings were madefor those that bought in 2010. Forexample, over the last years, it wasn’tthat good, but it recently spiked, so thatthose that have such a company mightthink about selling it now and thenbuying something that is still moreundervalued, according to Lynch. Now Lynchowns such companies becausethose give good protection in recessions.

Companies that continue to grow do theirown business, don’t mind about what’sgoing on in the economy; that’s a goodbusiness and that gives you protection ina recession. Okay, you have to check howeach performed in a recession over theprevious three, four, or five recessions.You need to go a lot back in time.

It was a different case in the 1980s, butcheck how it works, Howard; the earningshit what's the payout with the dividend,and then see how much safety you want inyour portfolio and how much weight youwant for such companies in yourportfolio. The expectations for suchcompanies make forty to fifty percentand sell. Always keep some in yourportfolio for recession protection. Checkthe ups and downs during recession; it'sunlikely that these companies go out ofbusiness. The price to earnings ratio willtell you the value. Beware ofdiversification, where they invest instupid growth at any cost. Then the fastgrowers, Lynch's favorite stocks, thestocks that if you find one that isgreat, it makes an investment career, notjust a great investment. Those are thefast growers, growing between 20 and 25percent per year, not above 50% becausethat's a hot stock, and Lynch doesn'tlike hot stocks because there is a lotof competition if their market isgrowing so fast. Everybody wants in. Thinkabout Uber, Lyft, and all those hotthings. So, a little bit slower; not thathot, but strong sustainable growth; a greatbusiness model and great earnings.

An example of that is Starbucks in the1990s. If they look at their growth stock29%, 22%, 24%, 24%, 30% in the 2000s, thecompany was growing and had a confirmedbusiness plan in the US. Then it wentglobal. Those who invested in the 1990s endedup with a 20-bagger; those who investedlater did still well but not as well asthe company started growing. Let’s sayit grew more slowly. So what are the expectations?If growth slows down, the market doesn’tlike it. If finances become an issue, it’slikely you could go to Chapter 11. So you haveto look for good balance sheets, makingsubstantial profits, figure out whenthey'll stop growing and how much youwill pay for that growth. At some point,they will stop growing and turn intosomething else. That’s the only guarantee;that’s a certainty. Check how much roomfor growth there is: 20% to 25% isthe best growth to avoid hot growth.Proven profitable expansion in more thanone city or country, like Starbucks did.The price-earnings ratio should be below thegrowth rate. So, still buying the earnings.Check whether growth is expanding orslowing down. Look for those fewinstitutions owned, and then you have.

Heard of? So, this is an excellentexplanation of what to look for inthose great investments. The nextcategory is cyclical. Cyclical follows theeconomy: automotive, airlines, tire companies,steel, chemicals, travel, etc. All cyclicalcompanies. The fourth stock is a perfectexample, down with every recession orslowdown. And down now, again, on theexpectation that there will be arecession. This is a typical cyclicalstock performance. So, what are theexpectations from such a stock toflourish when the economy turns good?Again, to suffer when there is noeconomic growth. Fifty percent drops are normal ifyou buy it at the wrong part of the cycle.You can wait for years before seeinganother upswing. For this down since 2013,large and well-known companies makeit easy for the unwary stock picker to partwith its money, because a lot bought in 2014,because it was a great thing. Timingis everything. Watch for inventories, andthen stocks usually decline when peakearnings are reached and investorsalready start expectinga recession. Look at Ford from 2014. So,know your cyclical stocks very well in thecar industry: three good years, three toFour or five bad years, and then you have tobuy new cars. The worse the slump, thebetter the recovery. It's easier topredict an upturn than a downturn. So wewill see when the upturn will come inthe automotive industry, and then we'llcheck the whole sector. Next, our turnaroundwill be around companies thatare close to Chapter 11, close tobankruptcy.

However, when bankruptcy fears ease,stocks explode, and that's how earningsare rated. That stock is related, andthere is a lot of potential. For example,Bank of America is a 10-bagger since2009. What are the expectations that explodeon the upside when things improve? Gobust when things don't improve. You haveto understand whether the issues are bigas perceived or not. If you can't simplysay next, can the company survive a raidfrom creditors? How will the company turnaround is what you have to ask.Restructuring is not good,even if perceived as such. One-timelosses make buying opportunities. Ifthose are real one-time losses, whatwill be the effects of cutting costs? Onecompany that might be a turnaround mightnot be at this moment is PG and E.

Then the last category is asset placement, as it plays a company sittingon something valuable that the market isoverlooking or it hasn't yet started tobring cash. Yes, economy cash, real estate,railroads, accounting losses, inventories,number of users, whatever that the marketisn't seeing. I remember buying primeAdriatic Mediterranean real estate for 1euro per square meter in 2010 becausenobody was looking at the value of theland. So that was what I was buyingin place of Amazon, as mentionedyesterday. So I was looking around me andfinding great businesses to invest in. So, no,the asset has patience until the valueunlocks. Look at the debt; look at themanagement destroying or creating value. Are thereany hidden assets? Is there an activistinvestment involved? Discussing yourideas, it’s always great to look forbusinesses around you and thenunderstand their value, their quality, andsystematize them into the six categorieswe discussed. I am very, very thankful forall the comments that came onyesterday’s video, and if someone wantsto find research ideas, stock marketresearch ideas, then the video yesterday.

It is full of ideas in the comments fromcompanies like American Airlines herethat people use and definitely thinkit's a good business, but that's aturnaround cyclical story. To categorizeit, then looking deeper, something veryinteresting: almost every ITbusiness uses their products and willcontinue to do so. Evenhardware stores put this on theiradverts as a paid option: QuestDiagnostics, LabCorp, used by the personwho commented in the sector. Further,coming from a biotech scientist'sbackground, we use TMO products inAcademy industry labs all the time, andthey can acquire great products, increasingthe price once they get you because theyknow you won't change your scientificprotocol. So, very interesting businessesto look at. Then you put them on thewatchlist, categorize them, and buy them.Windows are a great buy. More ideas fromAustria. In this case, IGrana that makessugar, RTL television, utility company, andthe largest brick producer in the world,we winner Berger. If you don't know thecompany, more ideas, this is veryinteresting. I work for Al Stone, and Isee how the railway business is growing.

Across the globe, while everyone focusedon electric cars, rail is veryinteresting. Also, electrichas more scalability and everything, and it paysa high dividend. Already a veryinteresting stock to categorize. Morebusinesses. My son, Dumont, said,I'll tell you, European businesses are very interesting.Oh, I have a lot of work to do,a lot of research to really findwhat is a buy, when it is a buy. See whatI should put on my research list, etc.

Spotify is mentioned very often as a lot ofpeople are using it, so another stock toresearch is PayPal, Restoration Hardware, etc.And then you see, okay, if you find suchbusinesses, okay, we know, like Markos says,he's heard about Atlassian, then theyoffer great products, and if you buy thatat the right time, then this is theresult: look from 20 to 153 in justthree to four years. So, it's a shame wedidn't see it, but it might still be. So, alot of research and a lot of great ideasfrom you, and this is what Peter Lynch isalways talking about: self-wealth fromAustralia, also expanding internationally,could be very, very interesting. So wehave to research. Back up to research allof these stock reports.

Research platform members will be veryhappy from the quantity of reportscoming from interesting businesses, continuingthe sector analysis. But when you analyzethem, then you have to see how it fitsyour investment strategy. So when itcomes to investment strategy, you usethese six categories and then you putthe idea into those, and then you knowwhat to expect, what to look for, andPeter Lynch says it's all about research.Investing in stocks without doingresearch is like playing stud pokerwithout looking at the cards. So you lookat researching. He says you need just a fewhours on each business to check what isimportant. So first, categorize thebusiness; we'll discuss later thefundamentals, and then you just need onehour a week to follow the stock. Learnabout the stock — that's also what I do. Ifyou don't have the time to do theresearch, you can always checkmy stock market research platform andthen see all my research in detail,reports on sectors and many, many stocks.Now, going back to Peter Lynch, just lookaround yourself, categorize, and thenwe'll discuss the fundamentals. So pleasesubscribe.

Click that notification. What are wegoing to talk about next? The perfect stock tobuy, stock to avoid, it's all aboutearnings. We'll talk about fundamentalsand how to do research.Thank you. I'm looking forward to yourcomments, any questions, any ideas, andI'll see you in the next video.
