[Music] I grew up eating burgers probably once a week on Sunday my family would go out buy a bunch of burgers bring them home and watch a movie on TV it's such a canonical food the flavor and Aroma and texture and the juiciness and you know all of that but there this huge dilemma that's posed by the fact that the way that we're producing meat is using a land area bigger than North America South America Australia and Europe 

combined the cows living on Earth outweigh every living Wild mamal by a factor of 10 animal farming is using an amount of water that could fill San Francisco Bay every day so how in the world are we going to do this there's actually an incredibly Simple Solution give people all the meat that they want but just produce it from completely non-animal sources what we had to do was some really really deep fundamental science to understand just in po terms all the 

features of a burger when you have the experience of the aroma and the flavor of beef in your head it's just this can only be one thing the delicious fresh cooked Burger but if you take those molecules separate them out one by one and smell them zero of them smell like meat they smell like caramel and butter burning match lilacs pineapple Martini was one of them you know there's no meat 

molecule the magic of meat is just this combination of ingredients that can be found from completely non-animal sources potatoes wheat coconuts a little bit from soybeans we pull out very specific components from each of those sources in just the right proportions and get something that looks tastes and Cooks like ground beef the thing that I call the magic ingredient for the flavor is heem it's the molecule that carries 

oxygen makes blood red yeast actually what's been used for many hundreds of years to make certain Belgian beers makes heem very well you get this potent Aroma of beef what we're producing is meat the delicious flavor and the nutrition and we've just figured out a way to produce it that doesn't have all the environmental destructive impact I mean I'm envisioning people having the same great experience with family and friends there's the aroma and the sizzle 

but I can also Imagine the kids saying wow you actually used to make these things out of animals how Wild is that [Music]
