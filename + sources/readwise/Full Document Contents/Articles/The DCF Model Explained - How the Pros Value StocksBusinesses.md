- Summary: The discounted cash flow (DCF) model helps investors estimate a company's value based on its future cash flows. By forecasting cash flows and accounting for the time value of money, investors can determine if a stock is undervalued. This method allows them to rationalize current stock prices and make informed investment decisions.

One of the ultimate goalsof researching a stock is trying tofigure out what the heck it's worth, whatyou think it should be trading for, orwhat its intrinsic value is, byestimating some sort of price that youthink it's worth. You compare that towhat it's currently trading for todetermine whether the stock isovervalued or if it's a good buyingopportunity. The problem is, of course,getting that number—figuring out whatthat intrinsic value is. There are anumber of different methods for tryingto get to this number. Multiples is oneoption that's kind of a quick and dirtyapproach, but one of the more detailedand defensible approaches is the DCF, orDiscounted Cash Flow model. This is howmany professionals and experts valuebusinesses to determine what they'rewilling to pay for them. And while it isa pretty involved process and probablymore advanced than the stuff I usuallycover on the channel, understanding howit works will give you a pretty goodappreciation for what people are paying.

For stocks, if you do so correctly, itcan give you a good base for judging aposition that you're interested in. So,let's go over what the DCF is and howyou can use it to judge a stock's valueon today's plain bagel.

Today's video is going to be a highlevel overview of what the DCF model isand the steps involved with putting onetogether. I'll be sticking to the basicdefinitions to help you develop a solidconceptual understanding of how the DCFworks. While I will point out how toget certain data points and how tocalculate certain things, I won't bediving as deep as I could into howcertain forecasts and assumptions aremade for the sake of saving time. But ifthere is interest in me going through astep-by-step example and maybe divingfurther into those details, do let meknow in the comments section down below,and I will put together a second videoto go through the steps that I willmention in today's video. But beforejumping into what the DCF actually is,I do want to highlight that, as amethod for estimating a stock's value, itis far, far, far from perfect. The DCFmodel is only as good as the estimates.

What you put into it is important, and because a lotof these estimates are going to be basedon rough forecasts and assumptions thatprobably will not pan out in the future,you just shouldn’t put any undue weighton the figure that you end up withthrough a DCF model. But with that beingsaid, the DCF is still a great way torationalize the current stock price of acompany to see what sort of estimatesthe market is baking into the stockprice. If, for example, you include veryconservative estimates in your model andend up with an intrinsic value that’sstill well above the current share price,then you can have greater confidencethat the position is attractively priced.

So, without further ado, ladies andgentlemen, I present to you the DCF model.All right, I know it doesn’t look allthat complicated, but this is adeceptively involved model. So let’sstart at the high level of what’s goingon here. With the DCF, we are essentiallyvaluing a business based on its futurecash flows. We forecast the cash flowsfor year one, year two, etc., etc., all theway to year end, which is theoreticallywhen the business stops operations. Now,most of the time, people actually useThis version of the model, where weforecast for some years as opposed to aninfinite number of years, and thensimplify the cash flow estimate fromthat point forward with this function.

Here,this section underneath is how wediscount the cash flows, and we do thisto account for the time value of money.Since the longer it takes for us to getthe money that we want from the business,the further we should discount thisamount, since it’s less attractive thanmoney today; and, to account for thecost of capital. Now, I’ll jump into thecost of capital later, but for now, youjust need to know that this is how wediscount the cash flows, hence the nameof the model.

Now, to explain why this formula gives usthe value of a company, let’s imagine afake example. Imagine you were to buy amoney printing machine. We’ll ignore thecatastrophic implications for inflationhere. How much would you be willing topay for this money printing machine?Chances are, you won’t care what it’smade of, how it looks, or anything likethat. You also wouldn’t care about howmuch money it’s printed in the past.

Since that went to its previous owner,you would only care about how much moneythis money-printing machine will giveyou from the moment you buy it andonwards. So, in determining what you’d bewilling to pay for it, this would likelybe the main focus of the function thatyou calculate. The same idea applies tohow we value a business as a rationalinvestor who only cares about makingmoney, whichwe allshould be. All we should care about ishow much money our investments willgenerate for us from the day we buy itand onwards. There are some models thatconsider other things. There are somethat focus on how much the assets areworth if the company were to selleverything off. But for a going concern,the DCF is a more appropriatemethod. So, that’s an overview of the DCFmodel. Now, let’s get into these stepsinvolved with putting this all together.The first step is to forecast our cashflows.Naturally, cash flows, as you may know,represent the actual cash a business isgenerating from its operations, and thereare actually two options here for theThe cash flow figure that we're using is thefree cash flow to firm, also known as unleveragedfree cash flow, and the free cash flow toequity, also known as leveraged free cash flow. Freecash flow to firm is how much money thecompany generates for all of itsinvesting stakeholders, meaning bothshareholders and bondholders, or thelenders, while free cash flow to equityis just the amount of money generatedfor shareholders, or us. Now, you can useeither method here, but I'm going tofocus on the free cash flow to firmsince I think it provides a betterconceptual framework of how the DCFworks, and the two should lead to the sameor similar result. But with the free cashflow to firm, we do need to make someadjustments at the end to get to ourestimated share value, so do keep that inmind. Now, estimating the free cash flow to the firmis by far the longest step of the DCF.

You first need to forecast the company'sincome statement, including their revenueforecasts and expenses, all the way downto their earnings before interest andtax, or EBIT. This usually means takingthe latest year of actual results asyour starting point and tacking on someSort of growth assumption to each line item. A lot of people will do theirresearch into forecasting sales and thenbase operations on some percentage ofthe sales forecast. Once we do this and get all the way downto our EBIT for a given year, we make thefollowing adjustments to get to our freecash flow to firm. We first deduct taxessince that’s obviously something wedon’t get to keep and pay out to thegovernment. Then there’s this wholepart here where we’re basicallyreversing accounting rules to try andextract the cash flow from our earnings.

Figure depreciation and amortization isa smoothed-out expense for a company’scapital expenditures, which is how muchmoney the company has actually investedinto fixed assets, a figure that you cangrab from their cash flow statement. Sowe want to reverse that smoothing outexpense by adding back depreciation andamortization from the income statement,and then subtracting the money that thecompany has actually spent on itsbusiness and its fixed assets. As forincreases in working capital, you canview this part as being how much moneyCurrent assets that it will need tooperate its business. It's calculated asthe current assets minus currentliabilities for this year, minus the samefigure from last year. But we actuallykeep out cash and current debt, whichwe'll bring into the model later on. SoCapEx is what money the company needs toinvest into their fixed assets to keepoperating and to keep their growthgoing. Increases in working capitalis what the company again needs toinvest in things like inventory andsupplies to meet their business demand.

Obviously, both these things will reducethe profits left over for us asinvestors, so we do need to estimate themand subtract them from our cash flow.Again, you can really go to townwith the method you use to estimatethese figures, going through thecompany's filings and their balancesheet. But I'll just stick with thesimple average percentage of salesmethod for the sake of the example. So weforecast these numbers and subtract themfrom our estimate, which leaves us withour free cash flow to the firm.Now, the second step, once we've done thatfor all of our years, is to forecast aThe terminal growth rate, as you mentioned, wedon't want to have to forecast aninfinite number of cash flows, so it'scommon to forecast anywhere from five toten years of operations and then toassume a constant growth rate thereafter.

To simplify our model moving forward, bydoing so we calculate a terminal value,which is this part of the DCF model overthere, and this represents how much thecompany is worth from that point in timemoving forward, assuming that it doesgrow at that constant rate that wehighlight. Most of the time, people willassume that the growth rate will reflectthe GDP growth rate of the country wherethe company operates, since there's anassumption that there will be aconvergence towards an average. So it'scommon to have a low single-digit growthrate here; it's not very defensible toassume a company will achieve doubledigit growth rates indefinitely with theterminal value assumption. So try not tobe too optimistic with that part. Once wehave our terminal growth figured out, thethird step is to calculate our discountrate. The rate we use for the free cashflow to firm is the weighted averagecost of capital, or WACC. This isEssentially, an average rate of returnis required by the company's bondholdersand their shareholders, aka us. Remember,both investors and debt holders haveclaims to this free cash flow, so weneed to calculate the return that bothparties will demand from the company. Therate of return required by bondholdersis easy enough because it's the interestrate that the company pays on its debt.

Because the interest rate that thecompany pays to its bondholders is taxdeductible, we include this tax factor.Basically, all this is doing is slightlylowering our cost of debt to considerthe fact that the money paid towards thebondholders will reduce the company'staxable income. So, on a net basis, it willgive us some advantage to having debtversus equity. Now, the return on equityis a bit more of an abstract figure; it'sbasically whatever investors demand fromthe company. So, it's whatever we decideit will be, higher or should be higheranyway for higher risk companies, andlower for safer and more mature firms. Toestimate this amount, you could startfrom eight percent as an example andsimply adjust to reflect the risk of thecash flows that you're estimating.

A company that’s forecasting cash flowgrowth above 20%, for example, shouldprobably have a cost of equity wellabove eight percent since there’s a lotof downside to that sort of estimate.There is a more structured way tocalculate this number, well known asthe capital asset pricing model.While I’ll toss up the formula here, I’llleave a link in the description below toa page with more information on that ifyou want to learn more about that. Forthe purpose of saving time, I’m justgoing to skim over it here, but essentiallyit’s just a method for calculating thereturn you should demand as the investor.

Now, once we know our cost of debt andequity, we simply do a weighted averageof the two, where the equity weight isthe company’s market capitalization orthe sum of the value of all sharesoutstanding divided by totalcapitalization, which is market cap plustotal debt from the balance sheet. So,it’s essentially how much capital isinvested in the company, if you will, andthe debt weight is the debt divided bythat same denominator.

Now, importantly, if the company haspreferred shares or any other sort ofFinancing security would beincluded in another component of the WACCformula, but again, for the purpose ofsaving time, I'll just throw up theformula here and include a link in thedescription below if you'd like moredetails on that. Now, at this point, weshould have values for all of ourvariables in our model. So step four isto calculate the discounted cash flowfor the company. This will give us thecompany's enterprise value, how much allof its debt and equity is worth.

Now obviously, we don't want that valuefor the whole company, but rather whatbelongs to us as the shareholders. Sostep five is to adjust this to get ourshare value. There are essentially threeparts here. First, we subtract all otherinterests in the company so that we'releft with what belongs to theshareholders. This includes subtractingthe total debt, preferred shares if theyhave any, and minority interests. Fortotal, then preferred shares, you wouldideally use the market values here asopposed to their book values. But thatcan be hard to find and is outside thescope of this video. So I'll just includea link in the description below if youWant to learn more about those, andminority interests refer to how much ofthe company subsidiaries are owned byother companies and investors. So,obviously, we want to take that out aswell, since that doesn't belong to us. Now,the second part is to add the cash andcash equivalents from the balance sheetto our value here. So far, we've onlyvalued the company based on its futurecash flows, but if the business does comewith cash, we should account for that inthe price. If your money-printing machinewere to come with one million dollarsalready printed in its slot, you wouldprobably pay up to an extra milliondollars for that machine. Finally, wedivide this figure by the total sharesoutstanding, which we can find in thecompany's filings as well, andwe now have an estimate of the intrinsicvalue of the stock that we are analyzing.

Now, as I've hopefully demonstrated, therewere a lot of estimates and forecaststhat went into this figure, so the chancesthat it's perfectly accurate are prettyslim. But if anything else, the DCF letsyou see what a company would be worthunder different assumptions, so that youcan better gauge the price you're paying.

For the stock today,in fact, a lot of analysts will do somesort of sensitivity analysis where theyshow the output of the model underdifferent assumptions, which is a greatpractice for providing a good range ofvalues to compare to the current stockprice and see whether the stock isfairly priced, overvalued, or anundervalued buying opportunity.This video is sponsored by Blinkist, amobile app that summarizes non-fictionbooks on everything from investing tophilosophy. And if you enjoyed learningabout the DCF and want to dive intoother topics, whether they be investmentrelated or otherwise, you might enjoytheir app. Links lets you read or listento summaries of all sorts of differenttitles in usually under 15 minutes. I useit a lot to go over books I don't thinkI'll get to otherwise. I just recentlylistened to Buffettology, which iswritten by Warren Buffett'sdaughter-in-law and goes over hisinvestment process. On the completeopposite end, I recently listened toMeditations, which is a book from 170 A.D.written by this guy about philosophy. Butmaybe you don't want the summary; maybeYou want to go through the whole bookfrom front to back. I get it; some booksdeserve that attention. But the coolthing is, Blinkist does have audiobookson their platform that members get adiscounted price for. So if you want tolisten to a book while cooking orcleaning the house or whatever, it'sreally handy for that. And the cool thingis you can browse your entire librarybefore committing to making an account.

I hope you found somevalue in this video. Obviously, it was ahigher level overview of the DCF, but asyou can imagine, it would take some timeto go through all the differentvariables and how they can be forecastedand estimated. But as mentioned, if thereis interest in me going through anexample in a future video, please do letme know in the comment section downbelow, as well as any feedback you havefor the video. As always, thank you forjoining me today.Go value with stockor not.

I don't care.Thanks for joining.[Music]Um.[Music]You.
