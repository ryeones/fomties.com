the dumbest thing about ali selling a productivity book is that he's not productive at all I can't imagine putting myself in front of a camera and confidently chatting so much [ \_\_ ] while having achieved so little of use oh here we go wasted a spot in medicine for someone who could have actually had an impact on their Community just for his self serving goals what a beige human being wasted a spot in medicine hey friends welcome back to the channel this is going to be a bit of an interesting video because I am going to be reacting to some negative comments that people have written about me online now generally I make it a policy to not look 

at negativity um but what I've been hearing a lot from creators and other entrepreneurs recently and people wanting to start out as a Creator or as an entrepreneur is this fear of what will other people think of me and also the fear of what if I get negative comments about me online what if I get hate what if I get criticism I've been doing this stuff for the last 7 years on the internet and I think I've had my fair share of negative comments I realized pretty quickly that it is the best policy is to just not look at the stuff but for the sake of science for the sake of this video 

I asked my team to go through all of the sources they could find on the internet to find the meanest comments that people have written about me the most negative stuff honestly I'm not sure if we're going to publish this video I only want to publish it if I think it'll be it'll be useful or interesting and so if I end up just sort of crying uh that doesn't really particularly add much value to the viewer um but we're just going to give it a go and we are going to see what happens it seems Ali's book is finally on pre-order I saw the cover and I'm amazed that Cal Newport said it's a much needed antidote to hustle culture like dude Ali is hustle culture he thrives on on it he makes thousands to 

millions millions uh on it he thinks you have to watch an anime episode at four times speed question mark question mark question mark so either oi has seriously changed his ways all this book's ideas came from someone else like his staff and judging by his continued YouTube obsession with money he has not changed his ways H so they clearly haven't read the book because the book is actually an antidote I think to hustle culture this thing about how you have to watch an anime episode at fulltime speed I made a video you know I wanted to catch up on anime 

that my brother had recommended to me and I realized that if you watch it at two times or three times or four times speed you can still read the subtitles and you can get what's going on and then when it gets really epic you can switch back to one time speed and you can like absorb it and I posted this video online and this that video seems to have been sort of shared far and wide where people are using holding it up as like [ \_\_ ] this guy hustle culture the hor bang a com a comment like this doesn't really make me feel anything the whole obsession with money thing is also interesting like you know I make no real 

secret of the fact that hey I'm an entrepreneur part of building a business is trying to make money out of it the way you make money is by adding value to people and you know if you add value to a lot of people you make a lot of money that sort of thing I don't know I don't think this one is this one doesn't really really affect me very much from 2023 I wish that Ali would stop calling what he does teaching and education he is not a qualified teacher and regurgitating some book summaries every week hosting a podcast and making courses based based on anecdotal experience doesn't make you 

a teacher okay that's interesting I would actually really just disagree with this I have a guitar teacher he teaches me guitar he does not have any qualifications in teaching but he is still a guitar teacher because he's just one a few steps further ahead of me on the on the guitar Learning Journey and he's better at the guitar than I am and has spent a lot of time like working on that skill and therefore he's teaching me the skill I refer to him as my guitar teacher I think this sort of idea is something that really holds a lot of people back from sharing educational stuff online 

uh cuz they think that you have to be qualified in order to share something you don't need to have a special qualification in order to share stuff that you think is useful on the internet you're watching this right now you're probably not a qualified teacher but you could probably start a YouTube channel where you would you would summarize books that you've read you could probably start a Twitter account or a LinkedIn account where you would I don't know summarize lessons you've learned in your job over the last like 5 to 10 years if you're a student you could probably I don't know start an Instagram page where you share share your notes that you took when you were three years 

ago two years ago and one year ago all of this stuff I would say is teaching it's sharing educational things that you hope might be useful to at least one person I can appreciate the value of a teaching qualification I was toying with the idea of doing a postgraduate certificate in medical education at some point which in a way is a teaching qualification but you know just teaching man it's just like what is the definition of teaching Define teaching impart knowledge or instruct someone as to how to do something she taught him to read he taught me how to ride a bike yeah I think this is a this is a stupid criticism he is not a a qualified 

teacher and regurgitating some book summaries every week hosting a podcast and making courses based on an experience doesn't make you teacher okay fair enough oh by the way in case youve not yet subscribed to Life notes you might like to it is a completely free weekly-ish email that I send and it contains the notes that I'm taking throughout life so notes from books that I've read podcasts I've listened to videos I've watched conversations I've had experiences I've had and I condense all that stuff into an email that I send to my subscribers once a week it is completely free if you think it's terrible you can unsubscribe whenever you want there'll be a link down below oh here we go wasted a spot in medicine for someone who could have actually had 

an impact on their Community just for his self- serving goals absolute grifter and so far up his own ass comment you sound jealous wait until you're on the wards being treated like a servant by the band five nurses while you're on 15 an hour and come and come back to this wasted a spot in medicine I do agree with this to an extent um I did waste a spot in medicine uh I used to be a doctor I went through med school for 6 years worked as a doctor for two and a bit years and then decided to go full-time on this YouTube channel and that I now have um and had I 

known that I had no intention of practicing medicine had I known that I wouldn't practice medicine I would not have applied to medical school I get questions from students these days saying like hey I'm not really sure if I want to be a doctor should I do medicine anyway and my answer is usually no I think you should only do medicine if you know at that point that you you think you think you want to be a doctor having said that I also think it is totally reasonable to change your mind for example I decided aged 14 or 15 that I wanted to be a doctor because that's the age in the UK where where you have to decide what gcc's you're doing and then 

you have to figure out what a levels you're doing and you have to start doing work experience and all of that shebang in order to have a chance of getting into med school and decided at age 14 somewhere between aged 14 and aged 26 I realized that actually I preferred the being an online entrepreneur more so than I preferred being a doctor and I think it is totally reasonable to change your mind in that sense again I I'm not making this video as a way of like I defending myself against all these comments cuz I genuinely at least I think that I 

honestly could could not care less what these random commenters on Reddit on on Reddit think about this but I'm sharing this because if if just one person watches this if if you picked a career 10 years ago 15 years ago 20 years ago you actually do not have to be wedded to that thing that you picked you can if you realize that actually you building a life you love involves changing career it's totally okay even if that career is medicine even if that career wasted a spot from someone else we thankfully live in a society where you're not 

indentured in Into Slavery to that thing that you decided to do 15 or 10 or 15 years ago you are absolutely allowed to change your mind the dumbest thing about ali selling a productivity book is that he's not productive at all he constantly talks about how he struggles to do things for example go to the gym correct and his solution is always to pay someone to be his coach so he will do it uh that's one of my one of my Solutions that's not a solution possible for the vast majority of people and to be honest suggest he actually struggles with tasks that most people can motivate themselves to do okay his book has taken him years to write and that's despite him asking 

his readers explicitly what he should put in it repeatedly why would I want his productivity advice when he couldn't even think it up himself also as a side note why is no one on his team told him to stop posting these terrible pouting pics of himself he looks fine when he's not posing like girls used to in the 2010s but he pulls the same idiotic face in every pick honestly it's it's hard to know how to react to something like this other than to be like yeah I mean that's that's a fair point I'm not productive in the sense of motivating myself to go to the gym which is why I find strategies to use um the point of me writing a book about productivity 

was that I found some strategies when I was working full-time and trying to jug juggle growing a YouTube channel and a business I found some strategies that really helped I found the broaden and build Theory from Barbara fredericksen the theory of positive emotions the idea that feeling good about your work increases your productivity reduces your stress makes you more creative gives you more energy to give to the other important areas of your life I did I did a bunch of research into intrinsic and ex extrinsic motivation and other forms of motivation like identified and interjected motivation did a bunch of research into procrastination interviewed professors who specialize in studing procrastination put that into a 

book after trying some of the stuff myself that I hoped would help people in some way if this person does not want to read the book because they think that the fact that I struggle to go to the gym and motivate motivate myself to the gym means that any productivity book I write is going to be [ \_\_ ] then that's okay that's entirely fair enough also his book has taken him years to write and that's despite him asking readers explicitly what he should put in it repeatedly why would I want his productivity advice when he couldn't even think it up himself myself I mean 

me asking readers what to put in the book was was focused around like what are readers struggling with so that I know what the struggles of readers are so that I can address them in the book rather than rather than the book being purely my own personal experience when you're writing a book you got to figure out like okay who's your target audience and what are the problems that they have so instead it's not just an autobiographical account of hey these are the things I struggled with and what I did it's like trying to find an angle that's like okay loads of people say they struggle with procrastination loads of people say they get distracted loads of people struggle with Focus let me ask my audience what are the they struggle with so that I can then figure out like 

what are the things to to Target in the book I think I did also ask at some points using Twitter and Linkedin and stuff that hey I'm looking for an example of a story about this thing or I'm looking for a study that shows this thing or does anyone have any examples of a company that sort of came back from the brink of failure by applying the principle of play and people gave me replies to those be like hey you should check out the story of LeBron James you should check out the story of Adele and how she uses an alter ego you should look at the story of slack and how they pivoted from their whatever their was to get to the product at the end of at the 

end of the thing yeah I did absolutely use my audience use my audience in the sense of asking and pulling people for first stuff for the book I used to hate watch Ali's content but it's so Bal monochrome and boring by now I just check in every few weeks to see if anything controversial has happened what a beige human being honestly I've been caught a lot worse than a beige human being you know what I'll take that b beige human being sure I can't imagine putting myself in front 

of a camera and confidently chatting so much [ \_\_ ] while having achieved so little of use for these comments I'm re I'm really trying hard to really feel them see like is there anything about this that like yeah asleep Apple clearly can't imagine themselves in front of a camera while doing that I can I think this is also one of those things where people hold themselves back from doing stuff because they think they have to have achieved something in order to do the thing like hey in order to be 

sufficiently qualified to make videos on the internet summarizing books you must have achieved something major and then you're allowed to make video summarizing books I disagree with that principle I think anyone anyone watching this anyone in the world can simply choose to get out their phone make some videos put them on social media write some stuff put it on Twitter and Linkedin one of the great things about the time that we're living in is that no one needs to give you permission you don't need a qualification in order to do stuff you can just do stuff and you can let the 

market decide whether it's good or not so if you're watching this and thinking of doing something I would not let comments like what a sleep apple is saying where is basically implying that you have to have accomplished something in his eyes or her eyes uh you have to have accomplished something before you're allowed to then make anything sharing your experiences enco lift okay yeah he's pretty intelligent on gifted oh thanks I meant his latest productivity videos early on he had a lot of good advice but these days it seems like his videos are done by a team yep and he presents that's why I 

preferred some of his Vlogs on his second Channel they detail more about his journey right now behind the scenes with his business or even the podcast he would do with his brother both more useful and real than another productivity video I broadly agree with that um early on my productivity videos were based on advice that I was learning and following at the time these days my productivity videos uh occasionally they're based on like things that I have yet to learn but but like by this point I've been doing this 7 years and reading about productivity for like 15 by this point 

I've internalized a lot of sensible productivity advice and so I make the videos not because there a documentation of what I'm doing right now like hey guys I just discovered this new productivity hack I still do some of those occasionally if I genuinely do but I do them more because people in the audience ask people in the audience are struggling with Focus distraction procrastination I don't particularly struggle with Focus most of the time or distraction procrastination this is something I really don't want to do and so I think you know what let me share some advice on this that when in the hope that it might be useful to at least 

one person that is why I continue to do the Vlogs that is why I continue to do the podcast my podcast Deep dive it's just been conversations that I've I'm having with people where it's the conversation I want to have my Vlogs are designed to document the Journey of what's happening right now but the main Channel videos about productivity are not aimed at an audience that feels like they've already got on the value from them I was speaking to a friend of mine called Anor waraku he's like a huge YouTuber in India and I really liked what he said he said that if someone finds the content repetitive congratulations they have graduated from the course and I really like that approach if I went through the first 

year of med school again I would find it a bit repetitive and if I kept going to the same series of physiology lectures about respiratory physiology at some point I would find it repetitive that means great it's now time for me to move on I'd be more interested in the Vlogs of my respiratory physiology lecturer to be like what's what's his research about compared to his physiology respiratory physiology one1 course I like his active recall videos thank you but he also comes across as very arrogant and money orientated not sure why he did medicine in the first place after quitting following in only two years as a doctor yep see my previous comment about it's okay to change your mind his poor 

personality also makes him very unattractive to me too ah grapes and Cake fair enough I like his AC of recall videos thank you but he comes across as very arrogant and money orientated you know when people meet me in real life if they're like fans of the channel or whatever and they say hello to me one thing that a lot of them spontaneously say is like whoa you're the same person in real life as you're on your YouTube channel and I view I personally view that as a compliment because it shows that hero YouTube I'm not trying to be 

anything other than what I am if someone thinks that I'm arrogant in real life or on the YouTube channel okay you know not everyone is not everyone's personality is everyone else's cup of tea money orientated yeah I'm pretty money orientated I think making money is an important life skill I think money buys you freedom to be able to do what you want freedom and flexibility um since having money my life is better than before I had money because now I'm in control of my time I've also been giving away 10% of everything that I earned to charity since 2019 so the more money I make the more money 

I can give away to charity as well but yeah I am pretty money orientated I think money buys Freedom security and allows you to do the things that you want and gives you more flexibility to build a life you love all right here we go he goes about his Day filming a video and then has another camera recording him from a different angle while he does that which he then releases a week later as a separate day in my life video yeah I do sometimes is that a criticism it's like I'm filming this video I'm not doing a vlog today but if I were doing a vlog I would be filming myself filming this video because this is a day in my life I started the day off with breakfast at a local coffee shop and 

some journaling then my team came over and we had a bit of a chat had some coffee filmed a couple of videos and if I'm documenting that in a vlog I have another camera filming me usually this bad boy which is a little camera that I have on the side and this is this is the day of my life back in the day when I would do day in my life Vlogs it would be when I was studying for my exams as a student then it would be when I was working as a doctor then it would be in the middle of the pandemic when I was trying to build a business then it would be when I moved to London and I had a team in an office and stuff what the point of the day in the life logs this man all right te and lifting ooh who's actually fy2 Foundation year 2 he has millions of 

followers but has an ego fragile enough to get butt hurt from blatant troll comments by people without a profile picture on Instagram do I get butt hurt from blatant troll comments from people on Instagram without a profile picture I sometimes post them on my Instagram story I didn't realize that that comes across as butt hurt I mostly post them for entertainment purposes cuz it's kind of funny but grifter is going to grift and I can't fault him for that he's good at what he does oh thank you what is a grifter of a person who engages in Petty or small scale 

swindling I'm curious like what's what's the swindling that these people think I do I think people call anyone who sells an online course like a grifter but I know a lot of people who sell online courses they're basically everyone I know who sells online courses is very nice person and they have like no questions asked money back guarantees and like a full-time staff of customer support people like I do we have like five people on our customer support team so that when people email us and ask us questions even if they've bought a course 5 years ago we still try our best to answer them and be a be super helpful to them and so that anytime someone emails us asking for a refund for pretty 

much whatever reason we just give him their money back he likes money he loves money NAD dog he lives for money he gets orgasm thinking about money he likes money just like how homelander likes milk but yeah I do like money I I don't think I get an orgasm thinking about money cuz I think about money a lot um I also don't think I live for money who who is homelander homelander is the leader of the seven the strongest soup in the world the main antagonist of the Amazon series the boys love that that's is actually 

kind of funny OMG at least said he charges 20K for a sponsored YouTube video I want to cry the payoff is he is probably soulless inside he's a massive sellout yeah we charged 20K I think it's it's increased now for a sponsored YouTube video so if if if the theory is he should be a doctor and he quit medicine because he wanted to be a YouTuber for the money and therefore he's a sellout it's like yeah I agree I'm I'm a sellout in that sense um I disagree that having a medical degree means you should be a doctor think there 

are a lot of people doing careers outside of medicine who have medical degrees um I reserve the right to change my mind as I think does does everyone so but I I think that's probably what they're referring to as sellout that he should have been doing something altruistic and low paid like medicine but instead he chose to sell out at one point I was thinking of moving to the US to do medicine there and a bunch of people were calling me a sellout then because it's like you should be a doctor in the UK where you're being paid 144 an hour rather than try and move to the US 

where you get paid a lot more still practicing medicine um possibly because you get paid more and or there's a private healthcare system sort of in the US I think it's so it's it's interesting filming this video sort of 7 years after the journey started um I actually did a video on my on my podcast Channel with my brother sort of reacting to me comments maybe like 4 years ago and in that video you can see that like I'm visibly upset by by the comments because I think that was the first time that I'd really confronted negative comments and sort of that barrage really of like made 

me feel like I think over time one one of two things has happened either I have become better at dissociating from the ego um maybe that's part of it because I've been reading a bunch of these spiritual books I did an iasa Retreat about a year ago I have had like a friend who's a kind of Coach SL therapist SLS spiritual guider in some way like all of these things that these people are saying are things that I have thought about myself at one point or another of like is my content just meaningless am I just regurgitating getting shitty summaries from like popular books am I have I lost any value 

I have to society because I once was a doctor and then decided not to be a doctor am I a sellout am I a grift or is that is the stuff are the courses that we're selling actually like really crap and we're just sort of scamming people out of their money and they're so gullible that they're being scammed out their money and it's like like all of these things are things that I've thought about myself at one point or another and I've always come up with answers to that be like no I think it is that's why we have a money back guarantee if someone wants a money back we give the money back one one thing I found helpful was was to think what what 

must be true for this comment to be correct like am I a bad person for quitting medicine to do YouTube hm I used to I used to be really worried about that and then I thought about it a lot and realized no I'm actually not I don't agree with the principle that you should never change your mind on what career you want to do I don't agree with the idea that if you signed up to do career X even if career X is more altruistic that you should then not switch to Career y because you realize career Y is more profitable more fun more fulfilling 

more flexible whatever the thing might be and so provided I don't agree with that assessment do I still believe the initial criticism the answer is no and then it's almost like over time like the thing about oh I'm not sufficiently qualified to write a productivity book The question is like how qualified does one need to be to write a productivity book how qualified does one need to be to write a book do I believe that in order to write a book and publish a book and have the audacity to sell a book or make videos or write blog posts that you need to have some sort of arbitrary qualification no do I think the only people who get to 

share stuff online that might be helpful to others need a teaching qualification no I don't think so so if that's true then great that criticism no longer has any legs one of the things I like about seeing seeing negative comments is that if I feel something about it that then reveals an area where I'm like o that was a that was a bit of ego defense there it's like that specific comment about how Ali's content used to be valuable back when he was a real doctor and now he's just a grifting 

entrepreneur and selling courses about how to be a YouTuber and so his content is no longer valuable o o there's something about that that's spicy and the spiciness of that makes me want to explore it a little bit more to understand like okay hm exploring it with a sense of curiosity a sense of like do I agree with that do I disagree with that like what are the reasons for that like why do I feel this emotional response to that thing so for these comments like most of the most of my responses to this was just exasperation and frustration exasperation cuz I'm like [ \_\_ ] this [ \_\_ ] again okay fine 

exasperation cuz I'm like do people have nothing better to do than than make these sorts of comments online but exasperation also because I think what these comments reveal is genuinely the stuff that holds people back from becoming creators I'm I'm finding myself sort of getting riled up by this which is interesting cuz I think it shows that I feel fairly strongly about this cuz my whole shtick and whenever I have conversations with people where I see that like this fear of what other people will say is is holding them back from living a life that could be way better than the one that they're that they're currently living and they want to do it but they're held back by this 

fear this like negativity this idea of like what are my friends and family going to think what are the people in my University going to think what are my cousins going to think oh my God they're going to say that this person started a YouTube channel boohoo it's like every single person I know who has started a YouTube channel who started a business has had naysayers early on in their journey and then as you get become more and more successful you have even more of them but every person I know who has done this and succeeded In fairness so there's some survivorship bias has not regretted that decision they've said it's one of the best decisions they ever made even people I know who have started 

YouTube channels and quit 2 years later because they didn't go anywhere have still not regretted it because they've learned a lot about themselves they learn new skills they overcame some like emotional hurdles all of that stuff and I think it is such a shame when comments like this on a random like gossip forums or random subreddits where people read those comments it's like I'm probably not going to make it a habit to read the comments so people commenting this stuff doesn't actually affect me but what it does is that for the other thousands of people that are read those comments it reinforces to them the idea that no you 

know the crabs in a bucket thing I I can't possibly like I can't possibly try and do my own thing I can't possibly try and break free from this Barrel that I'm in because the other crabs are going to drag me down and what I see from these comments is like the crabs in a crabs in a bucket thing these are crabs trying to drag trying to drag other people down it doesn't affect me I'm rich enough I've got a business I can kind of do what I want but it affects those people that are not doing the thing because they're worried about this sort of response which I think is where the sense of like uh exasperation comes from so this is 

probably a very long and rambly video if you've gotten to this point thank you for watching I hope you got some value out of this video um but yeah that's the vibe um yeah thanks for watching see you next time bye
