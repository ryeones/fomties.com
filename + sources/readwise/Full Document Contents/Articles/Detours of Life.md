[Music] detours of Life how attaining Clarity of our emotions unconscious money narratives and habits play a role in empowering us to achieve our goals the home we purchase and now live in to us more than six years to arrive the story behind it was filled with many detours disappointments upheavals adventures and finally Joy in hindsight some things I've learned from my journey include having Clarity 

of what my values are what my decision criteria are and writing down things to make them happen in Singapore we had the opportunity to ballot for our first home as a couple however none of the homes fit our following criteria first a place that was near a place of worship second somewhere near our parents that somewhere near a green spot as we're both nature nervous and lastly a budget around the range of 350 000 

dollars we even took the route to source for resale Flats but found that many of these Flats were in really poor condition a Dosa may have fit some of our criteria it meant that we had to exceed our budget to renovate the place hence we settle on renting a place in our first year of marriage at that time we were fighting a lot as newlyweds learning to adjust to and live with each other we implemented built the house day where we would face a 

spreadsheet and discuss our future house we still try to practice this at least once every quarter to discuss major financial decisions renting was a first detour the second detour came during a season as entrepreneurs facing a tight cash flow we could not afford to continue renting and decided after much deliberation to move her in with my parents for about 8 months the third detour came when I realized we 

needed our own space to exercise our freedom by then we have built more reserves and we had a goal to purchase our home while we managed to ballot for a flat in a favorable location none of the other criteria were met we were dejected I had also started taking investing classes driven by the thought that if I could learn to invest time money and knowledge regenerate passive income it will enable me to have the freedom of space that my husband and I will 

appreciate in this season of our marriage we unconsciously inherit money narratives that factor into our decision making has money become the source that dictates the way we live I had to be true to my values when faced with that decision to either rent or stay with my parents after getting married both of us value Freedom space and our relationship as husband and wife the fourth and final detour was when we balloted for a flat in the neighborhood 

we had not initially considered this time we re-evaluated the conditions against our criteria and realized that it made three out of four of the criteria we decided to secure the flat and could not be happier with our decision in hindsight I realized that life happens in seasons detours are like pit stops that help us to recalibrate what we truly want and what we do not want hindsight is a powerful teacher as it helps us to recognize that detours bring 

us closer to our goal and our ideal purchase it was also powerful how our thoughts scripts and money narratives determine the choices we made
