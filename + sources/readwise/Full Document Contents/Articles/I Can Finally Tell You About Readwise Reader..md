## Full Document
- Whenever I've shared about my workflow for processing articles,
books, and more into Obsidian, you may have noticed that I glossed over the specifics a little bit and just focused on everything
after they get into Obsidian. And that's because until
recently, last night in fact, I'd been asked not to share too much about a product that I
love and use heavily, one of my favorite tools
for learning in general and one of my favorite
companies, Readwise, just gave the go ahead for sharing in public a little bit more 

about this awesome new
product called Reader. I've actually been using
it for over a year now. I first started using it in August, 2021 and I am super excited not to have to keep it a secret anymore because it is awesome. A caveat before we continue though, it is not officially launched yet and probably won't be till next year. However, you can sign
up for a wait list now 

and it is out of that private beta period. So your chances are higher than ever. But I still wanna show
you how awesome it is. So here's what you need to know. First, what is Readwise? Readwise was already a service, a platform that let you
take your highlights from a variety of sources like eBooks, and tweets, and podcasts, but there were still a few sources that were missing, namely articles, there wasn't really a good
way to do it within Readwise. So what I did, and what
many other people did, was to use another service like Instapaper 

or there a bunch of other ones, maybe like Pocket and that kind of thing. And we would use that to
highlight web articles and then maybe put them into Readwise and then from Readwise,
get them into Obsidian. As you might imagine,
that wasn't exactly ideal because I still had to
pay for two services and have two different
accounts, but I still did just because I really like
that automated workflow. Reader is the answer to all of that. With Reader, I no longer need Instapaper 

or any sort of read it later app. It's hard to say that
it's a read it later app, because it's also like a newsletter app, and it's a podcast app,
and it's a tweet app. So it's basically this awesome thing that connects Readwise
to way more sources. Let me get right down to it
and show you how it works. Part of the Reader system is
this Chrome browser extension. Now I'm using Chrome, 'cause
that's a browser that I use, but you can also install
it on other browsers. 

And even if you use a
browser that isn't supported, they do have a JavaScript
applet that you can use. But once it's installed, you just click on this yellow R here and it says, "Saved to Reader." Now you can then leave this and then maybe choose to do it in Reader or you can just start
highlighting here as well. You'll see I have auto
highlighting turned on. That means that from now on, whenever I go back to this page, I can come in here and
then start highlighting and all of those highlights
will be synced to Reader. 

So let's say that I want
to highlight this thing. I just highlight it normally
by clicking and dragging, it comes up in yellow. However, if I'd rather use it as an actual read it later app, then I can just have it saved in Reader and then come back to it later. Here it is in the Reader app. Reader is a web app that you go to and you use your Readwise login. And we'll see that How
to Write Great Flashcards is already the top article in my inbox. 

We are right now in the library view. One of the cool things about Reader is that everything has
a keyboard shortcut. I mean, everything. You can navigate this entire thing without using your mouse if you wanted to. So in this view, this is kind of like
where everything lands. Think of it as your email inbox. And all of these things
here are either articles or books or emails or many other things. So this is the one that
we were looking at. And if I enter into that, 

you'll see that everything comes up. First, there's a cool outline on the left and then on the right, there's a bunch of
metadata like who wrote it. At any point I can type o, and it's going to bring
up the original article. One of the problems that
I had with Instapaper was it didn't quite
capture things like images or anything that was
in line other than text and so I often had to
go back to the original. I don't find myself doing
that too often with Reader, but it's certainly cool that
I can just head to this one 

and maybe copy the link in case I wanna share it with somebody. So going back to it on Reader, I can navigate using the arrow keys and we'll see that's
the highlight that I did while I was on the page. And I can keep going down here. It automatically scrolls up. See when it goes enough down the page, it kind of all goes back up so that it's always nice
and centered for me. And I really love that the images are also brought into here. 

So let's say I want to
highlight this heading and I'm just toggling that with an H and then maybe I want
this forgetting curve in my Obsidian vault. So I'm going to hit H on that and the image is highlighted. Now I'm not quite done with this, but I wanna move on with
the rest of the demo, so I'm going to hit L to move it to later. And this later tab here is
where it's going to live until I get back to it again. 

And this is the library. The next one is a feed. So I'm gonna show you how to add a feed. I've got my feed here. This is the RSS feed to my
site and I'm going to add it. And it says as adding
the newest five items. And here they all are. These are my last few blog posts. If I go into one of them, unfortunately, this one is a video and so they can't play videos within here, but I can always hit O and it'll take me to the actual site where
I can play that video. 

If I want to archive
this, just like in Gmail, I'm gonna hit E and
that's going to archive it and then I can select which
one I want to open next. But I've really seen all
of these before, of course. So I'm just going to hit
archive for all of them. You see, I could archive it even without going into it as well. So I already showed you this
view, which is the library, and this view, which is the feed. If at any point you want
to search for something, then you just hit / and then
you can type in something. 

So maybe I want to do
that second brains one. And there it is, the What Most People Get Dangerously Wrong About Building a Second
Brain is actually here. Exit that. Now let's go on to the different sources that we've got here. These are all numbered. So you can just mouse over these to see the keyboard shortcut. If you're familiar with
the app called Superhuman, I believe one of the people
that are working at Readwise is actually from Superhuman 

and so it is very similar in
terms of the user interface and just being able to navigate
using keyboard shortcuts. So let's hit 3 and this
is the article section. And this is kind of mocking the same thing that the library had except
this one is just for articles. So the things that are
in library are everything that are from the different
sources combined into one view, but you can also go one
by one into each source in case you have different workflows. In articles, you can see the inbox, 

later, and archive as well, you can sort by date saved
or a bunch of other things, and you can browse through
the articles here as well, and see the metadata update on the right. The next section is books. I actually read most of my
books these days on the Kindle, whether that's in my Kindle
app on my iPad or on my phone, which is a Galaxy Z Fold3. With the Kindle, all of those highlights are automatically bypassing Reader and going into Readwise
to be sent into Obsidian. 

But this book section is great because it also accepts
different formats, like ePub. I just got this awesome
ePub from a creator that I admire, Elizabeth Phillips, and it looks pretty good. The experience is not bad. I mean, you do get these weird things like the page numbers are here and then her name and that kind of thing, but you can still highlight everything. And I showed earlier
how you can just hit H to highlight the entire paragraph, 

but you can just
highlight normally as well and that'll go through. You can also add comments. I rarely do that. And add tags. I never do that, but maybe you will. And you can also copy text
and disable auto highlight if you don't like that things
are automatically highlighted when you select them here. The next one is emails,
that's number five. When you get into Reader, you'll be given this special email address and anything that you
send to that email address from the email address that you've used 

for your Readwise
account will end up here. This is my Mailbrew replacement because I used to Mailbrew
because it was a separate place that I could have stuff sent to, but now I just get it
sent to my Readwise email. The other thing is, if
you have some newsletters that you've already signed up to using your own personal email address, then you can just forward them all into your Readwise email address by setting up an auto
forwarder rule in Gmail or whatever email client you use. Let's look at this one by Matt D'Avella. 

He has a newsletter called Slow Growth and a course called Master
YouTube that it's based on. Let's say that I want to
highlight this hedonic principle. You also see an outline here, so you can skip to the part
that you're more interested in. Then you can archive it when you're done. Number six is PDFs. I've been actually using this
for surprise, surprise, RPGs. This is a PDF that I uploaded. I'm going to get rid of the sidebar here by pressing the right bracket 

and I'm just increasing the size here. And you can highlight
directly on the page. This is a page from the PDF of the RPG for the One Ring which is an
RPG based on Lord of the Rings. So let's say I want to highlight
this degree of success. It's kind of difficult to see because of the color of the background, but if you look closely, it's actually highlighted in yellow. And let's say this whole
thing is important. 

And I'm going to add a
note, "Rolling a success." And I'm gonna hit save. Without doing anything, it's somehow been able to parse this PDF and also show the section chapters here, which is actually really useful. And you can jump to any of these. If you don't wanna see that, then you can hit the left bracket and it's just you and the PDF, which is also pretty cool. Here's something that
is more work related. 

And I can zoom in here,
turn off the sidebars, and zoom in, and maybe
I'll highlight something like increasing,
"Organizational efficiency through standardization,"
blah, blah, blah, all of that mumbo jumbo. So it works pretty well
even in three column PDFs. By the way, this is why, for those people who have
commented saying like, "Hey, why don't you use this
PDF plugin in Obsidian?" This is why, because I've
just been using Reader. And the next one is number
seven, which is the tweets inbox. 

Now before this, I was already
sending tweets to Readwise, but they were bypassing Reader. Now everything goes through Reader. So let's go and see this in action. So let's pick up on this thread that was highlighted by my friend, Marie, about the WCAG guidelines. This seems like it is a tweet thread. So what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to hit this share button and I'll send it via direct message. 

You can also do a public tweet, but I don't necessarily
want to broadcast that to other people. And I'm going to select Readwise, which I'm already following, and you should probably too. And I'm going to say save
thread and hit enter. Says that the direct message was sent. And when I go back to Reader, you'll see it didn't take that long before this tweet thread showed up in my tweets inbox section. So if I entered that, all of
those tweets in the thread were there and it's all formatted
as if it were an article. 

Sometimes it's really frustrating to have a tweet thread there. And I used to use Unroll.Me or those other thread aggregation apps, but now Readwise does that in the process of
putting it into a Reader. So now I can go through every
tweet and highlight as usual. So I'm going to highlight that let's say. Going back to the main dashboard here, and the last feature is shortlist. 

Now there's nothing here yet, because this is so new
that I haven't used it yet. I read up on this and shortlist
is intended as a feature to help with a bit of
information overload. When you have an article or basically anything
that goes into Reader, you can hit S to kind
of tag it with shortlist or you can manually tag it with shortlist and it'll end up in this
separate shortlist folder. Let's try that out. So if we go back to
something in our inbox, let's go to this prime
factorizations wiki article 

that I imported from Brilliant. I'm going to hit S and let's
see, that was moved to later. Now if we go into shortlist, oh, okay, so that prime factorizations
article is already there. Let's try something in emails. Maybe I haven't read this yet, but let's see if I can do it
without even going into it. I'll hit S. Yep, that looks like
it was moved to later. And then it should, yep, it
shows up in shortlist as well. 

So this is kind of like
a way to star items. This plus button here is for
creating a filtered view. There is this Reader filtering guide that has a bunch of parameters and string ones that you
can use, and operators, oh you can do greater than, less than. Oh, this is cool, you
can even do short reads. Show me all documents shorter
than 10 minutes and in later. Okay, well I'm going to
do shorter than 10 minutes 

and maybe in inbox. So let me try that out and in inbox. Okay, this is really cool. So you can filter based on length. Oh, the problem is that, for example, these PDFs don't come with a length and so it's coming up as if they are shorter
than 10 minutes to read. I know for a fact that the One
Ring Core Rules is not that. So I can change this and type not PDF. Okay, that seems to have worked. 

It looks like everything
in here is not a PDF and they do look to be under 10 minutes. So that's really cool. If you only have a certain amount of time, then you can use this to
quickly go through stuff. I'm actually going to
save this view for later. Let's save this as quickies. And it got saved right here
and now it's number nine, which is pretty cool. So I can do 1 to go
there and 9 down there. All right, let's look
at this command palette. From this command palette, 

you can do pretty much everything. There's easy shortcuts for
triaging, later, archive, you can delete, oh you can
apply bulk actions as well, the help functionality. But let's go to apps here,
because if you're in doubt about how to use different
things, you can go into here and this is like your one stop shop for importing from any
type of document or source. Readwise can also import
from Instapaper and Pocket if you were already using that. Here were the browser extensions. 

And here's how you would
get connected to Twitter. And you could even just upload files, ePubs, and PDFs, from here. I've also been using Reader
on my mobile devices. On iPad, I typically just
go to the Reader page because when I open it in Safari, then all of the keyboard shortcuts work. And then on my Android mobile, there is also a mobile app for it, which I've found useful
for nighttime reading. But of course, you don't
get the cool benefits 

of keyboard shortcuts. Now I mentioned that
this works with Obsidian. This is the Readwise official plugin. You should already be using
it because it is awesome. But if not, you can install it. And then I would suggest that you configure the resync frequency to the earliest, which is an hour. I think by default it comes as manual, but I like for it to
pull it in automatically. If you want to trigger
a manual sync though, you can still do that by
hitting initiate sync. Let's look at some of those
things that we highlighted. 

Let's look at the second brain one. What Most People Get Dangerously Wrong. Okay, so isn't it cool
that it has the picture? Okay, it's a little distorted, but hey, that's still pretty cool. I also want the accessibility one. Again, a little distorted, but hey, look, it's still brought in the highlight. Now let's look at the one from the PDF, which was the One Ring Core Rules. It comes in as an article, I guess they don't have a PDF type yet. 

And let's look for the
one where I put in a note. So it has here new highlights
added September 6th, that's today, and this is the
highlight that I just did. And here's the note, "Rolling a success." If you're interested and
you're not using Obsidian, this actually does work
with a bunch of other apps like Roam Research, Notion, and Evernote, but I'm a little biased towards Obsidian. If you're as excited about this as I am, the first thing that you have to do is to sign up for a Readwise account. Go to Readwise.io/nicole and
you will get double the trial, 

so you don't even have to
pay anything to try this out. And then you can go to this page which is Readwise.io/read, and then you can sign up for early access. You'll have to enter your email address. So enter the email address that you used for your Readwise account. If you go to this part
of the page, it's me. I do wanna say, though, that I noticed in this
frequently asked question, "Will this affect the
pricing of Readwise?" It does say that, "When
we officially launch, 

we'll likely adjust pricing." This is totally understandable. I would expect that their
prices will increase. However, they do say that
they won't increase the price on your existing
subscription if you have one. So if you ask me, Readwise
is an awesome product anyway. I talked about it way before
I even knew about Reader. That's actually how I got
into the beta is because even before the Readwise
official Obsidian plugin, I had written up this Python
script that integrated Readwise 

with Obsidian and used the Readwise API to bring in highlights into Obsidian. But I think you don't
have anything to lose by trying it out for free. And then after you are
accepted for Reader, then you can go into this app section and then set up all of the integrations that you want to use. You don't have to use all of them. And then if you don't already have it, you can then install the
Readwise official plugin to Obsidian to just
complete the entire picture. Reader has dramatically
increased the value 

of Readwise for me, a
service that I already loved and had been using for
years even without Reader. Reader is so good that the same
day that I started using it, I canceled my Mailbrew and
Instapaper subscriptions. And that was over a year
ago, I haven't looked back. The best part about it all is that it all goes into Obsidian. I feel like I'm a shill right now, but I really love this product. So much so that I was really
excited to make this video. I've already made videos
about my processing workflow 

from Reader into Obsidian using the Readwise official plugin. So check out this video
to see a little bit more about that process. If you'd like to try out Readwise, and I really recommend it,
then check out this link. And if you sign up using it, then you get double the trial length that you would normally get. Thank you for watching. (Polish) Thank you!
