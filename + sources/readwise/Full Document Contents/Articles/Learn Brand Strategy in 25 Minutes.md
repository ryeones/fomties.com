## Full Document
all right today we're going to talk about brand strategy if you are a creative or have some creative skill set your early in your career and you want to learn how to advance into management make more money and develop the skills and toolkit to freelance you need brand strategy if you are in the middle of your career or at the end of your career and you're starting to realize hey I don't quite have the full toolkit to get where I want to go or I want to someday be more entrepreneurial or I want to have something that differentiates me you need brand strategy and what I've noticed for the people that follow me on this platform is you are either younger 

and pretty Savvy and you're trying to learn or you're older and you're pretty Savvy you're on YouTube and you're on Tik Tok and reals and you're trying to figure out those missing pieces and this is the exact toolkit that will separate that I'm going to talk a little bit about how I discovered brand strategy I'm going to go a bit into the cardinal rule you need to have to differentiate yourself as a branding person and creative that you either have it and you know how to do it or you don't and we'll talk about developing the toolkit for it we're going to go into the foundations of strategy developing a perspective for your brand your project Etc we're going 

to talk about turning perspectives into themes that can apply to campaigns and projects individual things you do we're going to talk about how you do examples and kind of document and present things to make them make sense and we're going talk about how strategy and tactics play a part in making ideas actionable inside Brands then we're going to talk about building your toolkit and like a feedback loop to actually get good at strategy over time and throughout I'll sprinkle in a decent amount about how you can approach this either entrepreneurially or with the idea of like making better choices to get you 

somewhere in your career or making money freelance if you noticed this week I dropped my first Vlog and I'm going be doing that once a week and tell a little bit more of like here's what I'm doing here's the things I'm working on but these videos that I do every Sunday I'm treating them essentially like summer school for people that want to be excellent at branding or their brand that I want to give you a toolkit in every video that you walk out with and you go oh I have something I can use now I can refer back to this I can make some docs from it and this is going to help me get where I want to go so let's do it so first off I was a designer first ER is IA and then in New York primarily 

graphic design I stumbled into doing things with a more luxury Bend one of the first big thorough projects I had was for a night club that was a super luxury oriented gold flakes in the drinks Ultra exclusive uh I was just as likely to spend the night there and T pay would be than Justin Bieber Lindsay Lohan broke up with her Samantha Ronson there there was a whole world revolving around this luxury feel that was very important to keep up I did the logos I did the menus I did the website I did all the flyers I really worked with the owner who became a good friend of mine a mentor to me over time uh into like what 

it takes to conjure that level of experience but that was a designer doing what I was told from briefs and ideas given to me by somebody I didn't make much money as a designer in that era where I started to make real money was when I applied strategy to design that's why I became a creative director at an agency and then when I began to make real real money corporate world was when I was able to take that into branding and sales and be not just like a young person who can both design and do some Basic Marketing tactics but someone who could say here's a strategy idea for what we should do for holiday or for 

this product launch and then over time I began to accumulate more money because I could do strategy on the side that's something where it's like hey I actually need to go spend 40 hours designing something I can have a network I can work with existing team and I can help them craft a strategy now it's you becoming entrepreneurial where strategy is a huge part of everyday life to today where I kind of I have a strategy understanding tactically of marketing and I understand the internet and social media so I'm in a constant flow of very well-paid Consulting specifically to do that and this could be you but what's the most important skill set I'm 

starting here with this image in this video I'm going show a bunch of examples of content here to help prove some points so why are we watching a video of women's wear being dropped up and down I'm doing this to talk to you about perspective there are marketers that are good and there's marketers that are bad and one thing that all the marketers that are good have in common is the ability to put themselves in their customer shoes and recognize when they are not their customer my first experience is this when I was working in the outdoors market and the customer I was selling to was a very wealthy Hunter as a young relatively Metropolitan guy 

who's spending my free money on like cameras and trying to go to ultra I did not know anything about what those people wanted but the ability to submerge myself into what they do was a huge differentiator in being able to sell to them and this is a skill set that you need to pick up and it starts just with acknowledging it acknowledging I am not my Target demographic and in some cases you might be it's going to be perfect and you are trying to sell the people just like you but for the vast majority of projects you are not the person you're selling to and here's why this is really important and here's why I bring up these video ideas is because 

on the internet everything is content everything is being sold through content it's being given to us on algorithms in my algorithm that I see personally as Orin guy into design and luxury goods and life in Southern California is not showing me this but it is showing the Target customer for a brand consult I'm working on this exact video and many more like it and so for me to be successful at understanding an audience I understand the people in it if a bunch of the audience follows Victoria Paris it's worth it for me to understand why Victor Victoria Paris is popular the 

kind of content she makes and how her influence Works to them and this is just an example because I work on a bunch of female focused Brands a lot mainly because there's a whole strategy component for these brands that seems to be underserved from a very tactical standpoint there's amazing creative for them but there's a connecting of the dots that I seem to have stumbled into a nisse shop but the same goes for luxury Brands Outdoors Brands Southern Brands Wellness Brands whatever it is just understanding your Target demographic it's putting them in their shoes and asking what would they do so as a strategist that is your job to ask a Who is the customer of this brand and then B 

who do we want the customer to be cuz sometimes those might be different every project starts with that who is the customer and is the current customer or the customer that we want and then you need to decide am I marketing the current customer or I marketing the customer we want is it a vent diagram that's also a circle or are we doing both and then you need to actually submerge yourself into what that person sees and wants and how they're sold and in particular content that impacts them brand strategy today is like 90% based on content which there's G be a lot of people that watch that and there go like oh my God this it's 1,00% true everything is content all the stuff I'm 

presenting in brand strategy is links to content because guess what brands do paid media and the paid media has content from the center and every agency and every person running paid media wants more content to run in the ads the brands are running organic content and trying to grow on there by making content themselves they are giving product to influencers who make content and they're putting out advertisements in other verticals that are often content in the form of ads there's almost nothing that they are doing that does not involve the quality of content from Center so this is actually a gift for you because it is easier than ever 

to put yourself in another customer shoes the first thing you do is you're going to start burner accounts on Instagram and Tik Tok and x and you are going to follow and only engage with on those accounts things in the niche you're looking for so for instance if you are looking at a women's wear accessories brand you're going to go follow influencers and women's wear accessories and the brands that do it and the easy way to do this Tik Tok makes this mad easy because say I'm diving into road the road customer I can go search Road and I immediately see these are popular people post Road I 

haven't heard of any of these people only one of them is from the road account if I want to go understand who the customer the road is appealing to I'm going to go click through 1002 200 I mean some serious volume of these I'm going to follow all of them and I'm going to interact with that content I'm not going to interact with anything else your entire job when you scroll those feeds and you intentionally put time to scroll those feeds is to understand this customer this placement and you on that account bookmark all the stuff that is going to be relevant now you have a whole path you can go look on for each demographic you do so I have hella account so many accounts that have 

second phones because I have an account where I'm looking purely at outdoors I have an account where I'm looking purely at luxury I have an account where I'm really trying to get Gen X male like understand what that looks like we have accounts just for weird [ \_\_ ] we have accounts for different types of like female focused Brands and then you can begin to then have your bookmarks all organized and look into it so if you basically make these burner accounts plus you do intentional scrolling which to me is like take 15 minutes once you've done your following whatever it is three times a week and scroll with the purpose of bookmarking something that is effective or interesting idea or 

a theme you see a bunch of you are collecting a catalog that serves as your perspective base and then you can have your traditional toolkit customer toolkit which is just putting together a sheet being like my customer is a you know I have an avatar presenting I have a customer I call her Ava she is a 34 year-old woman she loves to like here's where she shops here's the websites that she goes to here's what her social media looks like with some examples of people like that like here's her rough disposable income here's what she prioritizes begin to walk through what their life looks like in and around that that that exercise just beginning to 

craft that is great but also you know what's awesome is basing that around real people on social media and what's nice is you start searching through some of this find people that are doing videos about it have like 4,000 views that aren't influencers have an equal match of influencers to real people you'll start to see customer reviews and you can tell what's kind of promoted or not now you're beginning to build a real base and the deeper you go the better your strategy is going to be first chunk of career advice if you are working at a job and you are trying to uplevel in that job do this for that brand and I don't care what you do you're a videographer you're a photographer whatever you are you're in marketing 

you're in branding you're in sales you're in whatever if you go understand your customer Avatar and have a bunch of examples for it and then continually bring it up in the right circumstance when you're going through a strategy or talking about ideas or execution being like hey I actually have these three things that you know I've seen from this customer avatar from our competitor or like these three links are doing really well in our Niche right now you just like start to slide that stuff into emails and slacks and like be a person that has that and you are immediately going to become infinitely more valuable and people are going to notice it and you keep pushing it you have to be your own Champion but you're being your own 

Champion not like hey look at me I have all this great stuff just by putting more inputs out there and that is a significant differentiator in getting you where you want to go and then when you actually do end up in an interview or pushing for a position and you go and be like look I'm your blank blank designer or I'm your great videographer your excellent marketing manager I want to be your director and you know what I do better than anybody else that's going to come in for this position I understand our customer look at this here's 40 Links of the type of influencers that appeal to our customer here's all of our ugc categorized here's what I think is good and bad about it here's ideas that our competitors are 

doing that I've organized into slots if you come with a strategic perspective like that into an interview to move up people are going to like hey want you to be working on it and B be impressed the only thing you have to worry about is then being threatened and those are that kind of stuff that works itself out anyway because you're going to end up leaving scenarios where people who are above you are threatened by your success so now we're going to talk about turning a perspective into a theme everything in brand strategy is typically going to be based on themes and so I'm going to use this theme Here you see all these this luggage videos that are coming out so if I'm scrolling through this is something I'm was literally doing on a project 

scrolling through videos of like know women's wear accessories and I'm seeing a lot of like this travel theme I'm like all right cool this is all just the same produ presented in luggage but a cool viral format for Content but then I'm also noticing this Carousel that popped off where very similar theme a lot of things going on it's all kind of travel related you know but is obviously presenting luxury goods then I'm seeing this type of content where these kind of collages are really doing well I'm starting to think okay well there's a lot like Scenic photos and things in here like lifestyle as well and then it kind of clicks okay I've not started to see a bunch of this the theme I think 

that we should embrace for whatever we're working on is travel so what do I mean by theme and what does that go from there so why how do I use a theme so the things that you work on that need strategy usually fall into a couple buckets one we're going to make new ads got to make new ads we need to basically give a brief to whoever is going to make the ads the second thing is we need to make new content for our page for our whatever we need to find new ideas to make that content third we need other people to make content we need to find influencers or employee influencers and they need to make content or we're gifting out products to our customers and that needs that or we're making email campaigns to update our automation 

or we're doing a website all those things do better with themes they do better with an idea or a campaign like your traditional advertising campaign or Equinox being like you know uh oh you're going to bring Equinox up they're they're a good example they had like yearly campaigns for a minute like commit to something was like it was a theme it was a textu theme that they brought up that would be used overarching over time in a bunch of different stuff and you see they use it in like a bunch of different Graphics Etc Equinox made me do it another one more straight brand War law are most recent one that like these kind of very VIs Al sexual undertones but the commit 

to something campaign is one of the the more prolific but basically they have this kind of conceptual theme that they would then run through advertisements and things for a while and you can see how those will naturally expand but so if I notice this travel theme now it's a question of like what do I do with so you develop a theme for your campaigns and usually you're going to develop like two or three to kind of pitch to people be like hey for whatever it is we're doing we're going to I want to have this travel Focus or I want to have this other campaigns more focused on this I do a lot of this in notion docs and um so like uh one I worked on recently we were kind of positioning something that was more like like a coet theme like some kind of like if you haven't seen 

all the things that have like bows and these kind of very ornate pieces but done in a slightly minimalist manner we had a couple visual ideas in one and in brief kind of you'll have a few visual ideas where you're presenting a theme for the campaign and strategies about putting those themes forward and having examples of them and so I would take literally all these videos that I've shown here and I'd be like hey here's some examples of strategic content that kind of has this travel theme and it's a question of what do you do with it so once you kind of have that theme idea and you say here's an idea here's why I think our customer will like it here's a couple examples of interesting content themes and styles I'm seeing on the 

internet around it then it comes into the conversation of okay what do you actually do with it so I would say for instance if you're seeding influencer product so you're sending out a hundred of whatever product to your company every month to influencer you could say we should add a strategy layer to that maybe it's not doing good enough as it is so you can say hey we're going to do a campaign 90 days everything we send out to those influencers we want them to create content with a travel theme that is a strategy application that could be just as easy as hey we're running a bunch of ads 50% of the new ads we do we want to have a travel theme you basically take your campaign put it into the Json content that attaches to it and 

then you start to get into how you do it but for in this influencer case what I would is I'd actually collect these examples and be like hey we want you to incorporate our product the whole theme of the campaigns you're doing is travel you can interpret that as you made we'd like that to be a through line we want you to use luggage inside your videos we want you to be going places when you use our product you know if you want to be talking about it or integrating it in the things you do have it have this idea of going from one place to the other and so you can give whoever you're working with whe they're making ads or they're creative or they're editing a video or they're coming up a copy you give them this Steam and you give them some ideas 

and how they work through it then you give them a toolkit about how to make it good so here's an example of that for strategy one of the reasons like scrolling and stuff is great so POV is interesting so videos that say POV POV it's summer and you're picking her up to get ice cream every day that's what this artist did and you can have same as like I have a series on my on my valuable one I think um where I had like POV the plan is starting to come together or something like that um yeah POV the vision is coming together right but all it is is just a hook an idea for how you connect a bunch of imagery that comes after and so for instance when I look at you 

know obviously this content is doing just fine without necessarily my help but if I was doing this from a branded perspective and asking influencers to make you know content like this having it be like POV girls trip or whatever it is and then the theme of your campaign is girls trip and you're using that in your copy you're using it everywhere all of a sudden you're beginning to put a through line into what you're creating and when you're asking influencers to do that people are going you'll start to see the more people post it if you have 50 people actually engage with the thing in the campaign it has like a magic effect online it becomes a thing that other people people adopt because they're seeing it to start happen all of 

a sudden you're having like a bigger impact outside from what you've already kind of paid for or done you're begin to have a cultural impact and that's the kind of foundation of strategy is it gets people talking beyond what you pay to execute but what else can you do in a toolkit so for instance a great thing that I love to do going back to this first example is take a couple you see a couple themes of something happening in content like this is happening right now these videos are popping right now and a little like maybe a couple weeks ago these kind of videos where we're popping to just just kind of obviously they just flip the video and you'll start to see like when you see a couple of a format run cross your your screen you're going 

to be like oh this is a thing and then you can kind start looking to be like how long has this been a thing but either way give a couple pieces like this like these hanging upside down or the drop you saw or even something like this we looked at before put a couple clumps of examples together in the brief that you're giving to a creative teams or influencers and if you basically say here's some ideas that we see are doing well online right now you can use as a basis for your content and then you actually give them some tutorials go say here's how you do that in cap cut or go find million tutorials for how to do all this stuff on reals and Tik Tok just go find someone doing it and all of a 

sudden if you get an influencer brief or a brief your ad creative or your photo team and it's like here's this visual idea here's some examples of that visual idea performing well organically online here's a tutorial of how to actually do some of that right there now You' have completed the loop you are coming up of the strategy and helping other people implement it you are now probably the most useful person working onside one of these projects because you have the ability to say here's how we make it better and they have the ability to give people the toolkit to do it and so if you just focus on doing that on any of these projects you do especially if you're enabling others and the big part 

about strategy is maybe you're doing strategy you're than doing the final application on yourself maybe you're enabling others but either way you're about making it better so if you're the videographer a designer in this point you're hunting down all these for yourself so you can go I'm going to have a theme for this I'm going to execute it I'm going to use a new visual idea it's going to work and then you can use this basis and that's equally as powerful of a concept if you want to just be a better creative but then if you really want to move up in a career or you get into making money you're going to be doing this as part of a larger team and then when you start to take it to the next level you're going to have done this multiple times on M multiple projects you're going to develop a 

portfolio of this you're going to see what works and doesn't you're going to say I send people the examples but they never actually do that so then you're going to have to think about how am I briefing this or how am I communicating I need to do more of that or you're going to say hey I we I put these ideas in here but when they actually did them they didn't perform maybe it was just something that only worked at the time but you're going to start to say this idea of okay I need to communicate these ideas better or maybe to this demographic I communicate this differently or hey the trends move way faster by the time I actually get them out I you know Trend stuff doesn't work for me whatever that is feedback it look at every time you do a strategy postmortem what worked and what didn't 

and the key columns to have within that are does it not work because I didn't communicate it well enough or stay on top of the people well enough to execute it or did it not work because the idea didn't and there's a lot of times that falls in the First Column and it's not your fault and it's okay don't get attached to it don't live and die by it literally have the checkbox and say this didn't work but I don't think it was my bad but note what can I improve to make sure that it works next time then you have the ideas where you to say this this doesn't work or this does and then after 10 projects 15 projects 100 

projects you've got a toolkit this is your brand strategy toolkit you know you can go drop the bomb when you need something to work you know you have some things that are like might work in this circumstance you have some things you're dying to try but like now you're working with like a full deck as a strategist and the reason I think this is a thing worth bringing up and talking a lot about is I feel like so many of these creative roles are going to now be replaced to some extent by like people able to do it cheaper overseas some functions of AI Etc your ability to think critically about it and apply a critical toolkit in your customer shoes is something that like every person who 

really wants to succeed is going to have to do and what's nice is if you do this a few times you put together that kit that kit can literally be like here's a theme with a mood board all right and I'll show you one right here there's an exact one that we were just pitching out we like cool here's a big image that's a thematic what we're doing with this campaign here's a mood board I'm linking to like this is just a screenshot of a u from the cosmos mood board we made of all the examples and references visually we're looking at going into this project here's things that kind of entice us and we're interested in visually and I'll make this public on Cosmos you can go SC scroll scroll through it as well like here's some of the visual inspiration we 

have here's some brands that are doing some stuff like this in in the right way or that are kind of an example of this look that we're going for so you can see the content that they make and kind of how that's going and then I'll go into like amuse for it pick somebody who is embodying this kind of theme that we're going through and it's a good example that we'd say if we're looking for our perfect person to be like an embodiment of this would be this person list out some of the imagery we're looking at opens the door to what that means like can kind of talk a bit through like what the angle means we're talking about like this is an example of like a brief for this this isn't the craziest thing 

doesn't take you years to put together but it's a simple effective format that basically presents a strategy when you get a whole bunch of these even if you only get a handful your first two or three that you've done when you actually go to tell someone why should you hire me you go here's my process when I come up with I come up with a theme like this and it's based in reality in the customer Persona and then we go execute a campaign your ability to say that versus 90% of Freelancers that are competing for something is like such a leg up and if you do the kind of stuff I do like I'm basically showing this in public right now there will be brands that will hit me because of this YouTube video they'll be like I need that if you 

begin to document here's how I look at it or here's the theme or whatever it is you're beginning to build that portfolio and I'm going to do a whole separate video on like starting to build your personal brand not like becoming a full-time Creator or anything like that but like building your modern portfolio is one of the ones I'm about to hit in this in this series here I know I say all the time these videos I have these videos coming I do like write out a bunch of them I have a million ideas but that's one I think is really critical but you developed this over time and all of a sudden your Pinterest your Cosmos are filled with a bunch of these archetypes and links these campaign ideas and you have some results of what worked and what didn't and you're 

thinking in your customer shoes you are now a strategist you can use that job and that toolkit and it will be able to make you money it will allow you to rise up be able to manage others and be a crucial part of a team that may not be the person actually executing the work inside some of these organizations it's going to allow you to think being a manager being a director being a VP is usually a combination of of three things one is your ability to actually get results out of other people and communicate with other people two is your ability to have strategy and impact and three is the way you communicate upwards and communicate to other parts of the org in a way that makes them feel 

good about your efficiency that's probably a whole separate conversation too but this is one of those key three components and if you combin it with even one of the other two you are a fit for management which will make you much more money and then last if you just want to make a good work if you just want to be making better work for what you do you can take this angle with yourself anyway that is my quick and dirty guide to Brand strategy there is obviously significantly more Nuance in 100 layers you can do but if you want to do the minimum viable product that is going to allow you to create interesting better stuff and you're ble to Churn it cuz a lot of what we're doing today in 

today's world is about just [ \_\_ ] moving there's just so much content to make so many campaigns to do and everyone is behind in terms of the velocity and volume they should have and you can just knock out this type of thing you can just hammer it you can be doing this every week and you can be a major part of why your brand is moving fast and all these people were talking about brand strategy is these these 400 items or we got to go in this checklist or do these user interviews or whatever you can be like yeah you know what but what I'm doing actually works and see social results and the feedback loop is super quick so we're going to that because I can run 10 of them in the speed you can run that one process 

anyway a bit of a rabbit hole appreciate you watching if you have questions on this stuff you want to hit more in this series let me know appreciate you watching as always I will be back with a vlog in the middle of the week and another one of these next Sunday plus up
