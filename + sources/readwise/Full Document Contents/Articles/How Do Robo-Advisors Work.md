## Full Document
Robo-advisors are automated platforms 
for delivering some of the best practices   that human financial and investment 
advisors have developed over the years.  But how do robo-advisors actually work?
Each platform is different, but investing   through a robo-advisor generally starts 
with a questionnaire about your goals,   timeline and sensitivity to risk. Then the 
robo-advisor will pair you up with a curated   portfolio that matches your needs and preferences.
Once you’ve funded the account, the robo-advisor   

continuously monitors your portfolio.
As the individual assets in your portfolio rise   and fall along with the market, robo-advisors will 
look for opportunities to buy or sell investments,   to keep everything in the proportions that will 
help keep you on track to achieve your goals.
