- Summary: RGB (red, green, blue) is used for digital displays like monitors and creates colors by adding light. CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) is used for printing and creates colors by subtracting from a white background. When designing for print, always set up your artwork in CMYK to ensure accurate color representation.

## Full Document
there are two main color models used in design RGB and CMYK and it's important to know which to use and for what purpose RGB stands for red green and blue and is used for anything that is to be displayed on a monitor or screen such as websites or videos the very same screen you are watching this video on is most likely made up of millions of pixels each pixel is broken down into three sub pixels that are either red green or blue these sub pixels are added in various combin ations to make an 

array of different colors for the pixel for instance if the red and green sub pixels are turned on all the way the resulting pixel would be yellow or if the red pixel was dim and the blue pixel was on all the way the resulting color would be purple all three sub pixels added together create white which is why RGB is known as the additive color model cmy K on the other hand is a subtractive color model and creates white by subtracting colors CMYK stands for cyan magenta yellow and ke which is black and 

should be used for anything that is printed with ink cyk works by starting with a lighter page usually white and then layering each color together until the final image is produced this image is made up of tiny dots of either cyan magenta yellow or black the bigger the dot the more that color is represented and the more colors that overlap the darker the section of image will be in addition to CMYK printing you can also print with pan tone colors these are specifically colored inks and are a more accurate way of achieving a desired 

color that CMYK cannot perfectly represent panone colors can also include metallic inks that CMYK cannot produce when designing for print make sure you set up the artwork in CMYK and don't simply convert it later on and also keep in mind that you are viewing the CMYK file on an RGB screen and the final product might vary from what your screen shows for more information visit us at expresscards docomo have a range of videos to help you understand the very aspects of Print
