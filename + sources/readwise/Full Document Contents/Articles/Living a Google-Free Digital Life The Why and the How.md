## Full Document
Over the past
few years, I've been working to migrate as much of my digital life
as possible off of Google services. I've mentioned this in a few past videos,
and so I wanted to create this video to share a little bit more
about why I am doing this, as well as how. My interest was first sparked
in this by a tweet by Zach Gage. He is a indie game developer
who I really like his games. I think he is an interesting person and he had posted about different services
that he is moving off. So popular services he is leaving
and the alternatives that he is moving to. 

This was the first moment where I had
the realization that there were viable solutions to many of Google services
that were currently on the market. I started thinking more critically
about my own internet usage, and if it was sustainable
and whether it reflected my own values. Also, as I mentioned,
I wanted to make sure that there were quality alternatives because as much as philosophically,
I might want to leave Google services, it would be very difficult
to leave for a worse product. 

Like I become spoiled by quality products. And so I wanted to make sure
that the market had options for me. And I think that we're finally at a point
where there are some really good, really viable alternatives
to Google services that makes leaving actually practical, like leaving
Google is actually a practical thing that you can do now. In terms of the reason
why I am leaving Google services. There are two main reasons. The first is Google's ubiquity. 

It is everywhere, and the second is
its monetization structure. So first, to touch on its ubiquity,
it makes me sort of nervous to have one company run
every single aspect of my digital life. And with that comes lock in. So the effort cost of leaving is higher. The longer that you're there. It becomes really hard to replace. You are totally
at the whims of the company and what they decide to build, or what
they decide to just kill off as a product. 

Also, because Google services are free,
there is very little support. So if you have a problem
and you want to contact support, it's just really difficult to do that. You don't really have any numbers
or any chats or anything that you can really call
with Google services. In terms of the way Google is monetized,
it is almost completely ad supported like the rest of the web, which we can argue
whether that was a mistake or not. But when a company or when a service is ad supported,
it means that you are the product. 

You are not the customer. So you are the product. Being your information, your usage, your everything is being sold
as the product to the customer who is an ad buyer. And I think a much better, business
structure is for me to be the customer. And so for the companies to try to improve
the experience for me, the customer, because I am paying the money versus them
trying to improve the experience 

for advertisers or improve the experience
in order to sell more ads. It just is it at odds
with having a quality product? And I think over the years,
we've seen it play out and the quality of Google services
has sort of gone down as more advertising has become a bigger source of revenue
and more of a monster in its place across our entire society
and internet culture. 

But with all my idealism about Google
and why I'm leaving, I'm also a realist. And like I said, I wouldn't want to leave
a Google service for a worse version unless the benefits of using
that were so much greater. But for a long time
I really didn't mind if something, I didn't mind trading some of my privacy
and some of my usage history in exchange for using a better product,
but now that we've gotten to a place 

where a lot of the alternatives
are as good, if not better, it really causes or caused me
and might cause you to think about that cost benefit analysis, and whether it is still true
that you would rather trade your data for a free service,
which it very well might be, I say for 99% of people,
that would probably still be the case. Or whether,
at least for specific services, the cost benefit analysis is there
where you would rather trade money 

in exchange for a different service,
and especially when that service is better, that might change your
your calculus as well. This video does not cover
every single Google service. That would be insane. There are way too many Google services
to cover every single one in a video. Instead,
I've chosen ten that make up probably about 95 to 97% of my own usage, and very well might make up
the same percent for you as well. And I put them into four different
categories. 

One is completely replaced. So what I'm using now instead of Google. The second is what I would replace
if I cared enough. So there are viable solutions,
but they just aren't right for me for whatever reason. The other is
where I have partially replaced and the final category
is where I am staying with Google. Spoiler alert it's YouTube. You're watching this on YouTube, but I'll show you some of the other,
services that I've left. Coming up next. So let's jump into those Google services. 

The first Google service is Google Search. Ubiquitous. Everywhere you go to google.com
and you search, you type in a search term. And I have left this. I no longer use Google search
in favor of a search engine called Kagi. K-A-G-I. And Kagi is a privacy-first premium (premium
in that it's paid) search engine. That is absolutely fantastic. I was surprised when I used it that
the results could be as good as they are. 

So for a while
I decided to try DuckDuckGo, so I set it as my main search
engine many years ago, and I lasted maybe a month
before I came back to Google search. The problem was
I just couldn't find what I wanted when I was using search
and the quality just wasn't there. And so I went back to Google.
Then I discovered Kagi. I discovered it because of that tweet
by Zach Gage, and I gave it a try, and I was pleasantly surprised
to see that the search results were better 

and I was finding more
of what I was searching for. And so I kind of had no ha moment that, oh, I could viably leave Google
search in favor of Kagi. So I signed up for their paid plan. This has been over a year now
and I have not gone back to Google at all. I think Kagi
is, as I said, better than Google search. I really love a lot of their features
like lenses, I use their assistant. There's a lot of different things with Kagi that I really love, and I just
can't see going back to Google search. 

The next Google service is Gmail,
so I have left Gmail completely in favor of Proton Mail. So Proton Proton Mail,
like Kagi, is a privacy first product. So the email that really comes
with privacy first, I wasn't sure about it
being a primary email address. I feel like a lot of people
use it as a secondary or a privacy based secondary email address,
but it's fantastic. It is definitely a good replacement
for Gmail. 

For me, I use it as my main email. I use it with my own private domain,
which is nice because you can use a custom domain,
and if you were using a custom domain at a different email service,
you can just bring that over to proton. And so far I'm happy with it. I'm not totally using
a lot of the other proton services. So they have Calendar, they have Drive. they have a VPN,
which I do use sometimes, but I would say the big one is email. 

And I have definitely been able to leave
Gmail in favor of ProtonMail 100%. The next is the Google Chrome browser. So I was using Chrome or a Chrome Chromium
based browser. I used to use Brave for many years. I had a lot of muscle memory. I had to set up customize
exactly how I like, but Kagi was so good with the search engine
that I knew they had a browser. I was. I kind of waited more than a year before switching,
but I decided to give Orion a try, 

and this was maybe about four months ago,
and I've been super happy ever since. I do not miss Google Chrome
or Chromium browsers at all. Orion supports plugins from both Firefox
and Chrome. It has a lot of features
that match Safari, which I think Safari
is the best feature set for browsers, even though it's not my favorite browser
at all. I really like Chrome,
but now I can say I really like Orion. 

I'm actually using it on both my laptop as well as my phone
because they have a browser for both. And again, super happy. It's not something I really think about
once you kind of got used to the new browser and my muscle memory
was there, I just didn't think about it. It blends into the background,
which honestly is what I want from a browser. So very happy to not be using Google
Browser in favor of something else. And that's something else. Is Orion. Next up is Google
Photos and Google Photos. 

I've completely left it,
so I have a replacement, but I want to give an asterisk
because the replacement is not just worse, but significantly worse
than Google Photos. So Google Server, Google Photos might be
a service that you still want to stay on. but for me, I'm only really using it to back up my photos on my phone
and then browse. Sometimes because Google Photos browse
and search feature is just fantastic. 

It's really great. And this replacement is not,
but it backs up my photos. I don't use search that much. And so what I am using instead of Google
Services or Google Photos is Photo Prism. So Photo Prism is an application
that is self-hosted. So I am running it on a home server
in my apartment, and so that's running on my home server. All the photos are backed up on a Synology
NAS, and I am using an app called, Photo Sync on my phone, which sends
all of my photos to Photo Prism. 

And the setup is really great
in terms of peace of mind that all of my photos are backed up, and
I don't have to rely on a Google service to use AI to understand
what is in my photos, and then serve it to me via search,
which is kind of creepy. But yeah, the product just isn't there. So this is a hit or miss. I've completely left this Google service,
but you may not want to. Next up is Google Calendar. This one is easy. I'm just using Apple's version,
which is iCal. 

One of the downsides
is that when I get invited to an event via email,
so I get it to my proton email address, it definitely does
not automatically add to the calendar. That's now a manual process,
which if you're using both Gmail and Google Calendar,
you might be spoiled by the fact that they're intrinsically linked because
it just fits together so naturally. But it doesn't work that way
if you're using different services. And over time, I sort of like that. 

I have to be, manual and mindful with
events that I'm adding to my calendar. So this was a con for a while
and sort of made me regret switching. But at this point, I'm sort of happy
that I'm manually doing it now. but just keep that in mind. If you are planning to leave
Google, email. So Gmail as well as Google Calendar. The next Google service is Google Drive, and I am putting this in the category
of partially replaced. So as a backup tool I no longer use Google
Drive as a backup tool. 

I'm using my own self-hosted option. So like I said I have a Synology NAS. They just runs in my apartment
and all of my important files. I back up to that
and that is redundant on the NAS. And then I also back that up to the cloud. Google Drive is just hard to get away
from because it's fantastic for sharing files, it's fantastic
for getting files from people. And so for those uses, I'm
still using Google Drive 

because I have a free Gmail account
and it's free. I know that the Synology
NAS has similar options, but they're just a little bit more clunky
and not as nice as Google Drive. And so I just know
that I don't put anything sensitive or I don't put anything important
on Google Drive. So I treat Google Drive storage as
sort of ephemeral and anything important. I just manually store myself
on my Synology NAS. The next Google service is Google
Maps, and again, this is in
the partially replaced category. 

When I am browsing on the internet
on my laptop, computer. Definitely Google Maps. This is the best. there is an Apple Maps app. I don't like it as much. The website for Google Maps
reigns supreme, but on my iPhone, on my phone, Apple Maps is vastly superior to Google Maps and I feel like a lot of iPhone users
still use Google Maps. And I would encourage you to revisit that
mostly 

because when Apple Maps first launched,
it was terrible and it caught a reputation for being bad, and I think that reputation
stuck with them despite every single year improving until it got as good
as Google Maps and then it surpassed them. This was many years ago now. So if you are an apple iPhone user
and you're still using Google Maps, I would encourage you to try it. Switch over to Apple Maps. It's much more integrated into the system. 

The directions are fantastic. The user interface is better than
Google Maps and you might be a convert. You might not. Totally up to you, but for me, I feel like Apple
Maps is so much better than Google Maps on the iPhone. But website I'm still using, Google Maps. Next up is Google Docs. This is in, the category
that I would replace if I cared enough. I don't use Google Docs enough
to really care, but there is a cool alternative called Butter Docs
that I've heard great things about. I think it's like 100 bucks a year
as of the time of this recording. 

And if you're a big Google Docs user,
you have teams that sort of stuff. Definitely check out Butter Docs. but for me, I just don't care enough. So I'm using Google Docs. Still. Next also is Google Analytics. This is another in the category
that I'm still using Google Analytics. If I cared enough, I would switch
to something like Plausible or Matomo. I think it's called
but I don't care enough. It's free. I don't mind, I guess, giving all of my website data to Google,
they might as well have it. 

but it gives me some of the visibility
I need for my website, and that's good enough. And lastly, number ten is YouTube. Spoiler alert
because you are watching this, I am still using YouTube,
but there is no other viable alternative for video
sharing and community and stuff like this. So I'm still using YouTube
and I mean, I don't mind it. I wish the ads were better. shorter, more conscientious. Conscientious. But YouTube is what it is,
and I think it's here to stay. 

And that's it for this video. I hope you understand a little bit more
about the reasons why I'm leaving Google and have left,
and maybe got some inspiration. Maybe you learned of a couple of new
services that you might want to check out. If you've enjoyed this,
please give it a thumbs up. Give it a like all of those YouTube things
that everybody says and with all that said,
I will see you in the next video.
