**Good morning.** The good news: It’s the Saturday of a three-day weekend and there’s a juicy slate of playoff football. The bad news: It’s going to be freezing outside. A polar vortex will hit a big chunk of the US starting this weekend, sending temperatures plummeting to below zero for over 120 million people, which is more than a third of the US population. It’s also sending Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration inside. With temps in Washington, DC, expected to be in the low-20s on Monday (the coldest Inauguration Day in 40 years), Trump announced his inauguration ceremony will take place in the Capitol Rotunda.

To help keep you entertained while you hunker down, we’ve got an exciting Sunday special edition hitting your inboxes tomorrow morning. Stay warm!

Today and today only, there is no such thing as scrolling for way too long. Yesterday, the Supreme Court [rejected](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ulk?mblid=6df2d436f615&mbcid=38247254.4102487&mid=55ab9c4c00053927cd05204998094c31&mbuuid=PqBAe5c1bS3tvTDfxEgD98b1) TikTok’s legal challenge to its impending banishment from US phone screens. That means you might not be able to access your favorite app as soon as tomorrow—temporarily, at least.

**The decision was unanimous:** The bipartisan TikTok ban that President Joe Biden signed into law in April is constitutional, SCOTUS [ruled](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ull?mblid=6f2e16150b57&mbcid=38247254.4102487&mid=55ab9c4c00053927cd05204998094c31&mbuuid=PqBAe5c1bS3tvTDfxEgD98b1), as expected. The court found that “well-supported” national-security [concerns](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/tYT?mblid=8d8b4aa33aa2&mbcid=38247254.4102487&mid=55ab9c4c00053927cd05204998094c31&mbuuid=PqBAe5c1bS3tvTDfxEgD98b1) over alleged Chinese data collection via TikTok’s owner ByteDance take priority over the free speech rights of the app’s 170 million American users.

#### But your FYP could still be saved

The Biden administration has signaled that it won’t actually enforce the TikTok ban when it officially kicks in on Jan. 19. The baton will pass to President-elect Trump on Jan. 20, and he’s done a 180 on TikTok since his first term, when he initiated the push for a ban.

**Trump wants to keep TikTok accessible in the US…somehow.** He said he had a “good” call with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok yesterday. Once in office, Trump could…

* Issue an executive order—though legal experts say it might not hold up in court.
* Instruct his pick for attorney general, Pam Bondi, to ignore the ban. She [avoided answering](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ulm?mblid=e2048b7bb72f&mbcid=38247254.4102487&mid=55ab9c4c00053927cd05204998094c31&mbuuid=PqBAe5c1bS3tvTDfxEgD98b1) whether she’d enforce it at her Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday.

**As for a potential sale…**TikTok has denied reports that Chinese officials are considering selling the app to Elon Musk. Without a deal on the table, TikTok intends to keep its offices open, but plans to shut down services in the US, which would also remove liability risks for app distributors Apple and Google. To keep TikTok on our screens, Trump might need to convince Big Tech that his administration won’t collect the enormous penalties that app stores could legally get hit with if they keep carrying TikTok.*—ML*

The approval clears the way for the first phase of the three-phase agreement designed to end the 15-month war. The first phase, slated to begin tomorrow, calls for a release of hostages by Hamas and Palestinian prisoners by Israel, as well as humanitarian aid being allowed into Gaza.

The prescriptions that are up for negotiation are used by ~5.3 million seniors enrolled in Medicare and have cost the program $41 billion annually. This is the second round of negotiations to lower drug prices under the Inflation Reduction Act, a signature piece of legislation for the Biden administration. It’s unclear if President-elect Donald Trump will change the process going forward.

Amid images of the massive destruction from the LA wildfires, your feeds have probably been inundated with ways to help. A lot of those CTAs include the go-to for the new era of disaster recovery: a GoFundMe link. And while the site offers a direct way to financially support victims of the fires, it can make some aspects of recovery tricky.

Over $100 million has been raised so far through GoFundMe for LA wildfire victims, according to the platform. For context, $235 million total was raised via GoFundMe last year for natural disaster recovery overall.

GoFundMe created a [hub](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/uk-?mblid=3546fe3b5be6&mbcid=38247254.4102487&mid=55ab9c4c00053927cd05204998094c31&mbuuid=PqBAe5c1bS3tvTDfxEgD98b1) on its site for verified fundraisers, and, as of last night, there were 2,000+ separate fundraisers. But there are some drawbacks:

* Aside from the pressure on fire victims to package their devastation into an engaging narrative, experts warn that crowdfunding usually [favors](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/uk_?mblid=de75e78ee791&mbcid=38247254.4102487&mid=55ab9c4c00053927cd05204998094c31&mbuuid=PqBAe5c1bS3tvTDfxEgD98b1) wealthy people who have high-income social networks.
* FEMA has also warned that if families or individuals receive funds from GoFundMe for replacing a car or assisting with cleanup, it [jeopardizes](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ul0?mblid=5b455f084023&mbcid=38247254.4102487&mid=55ab9c4c00053927cd05204998094c31&mbuuid=PqBAe5c1bS3tvTDfxEgD98b1) their chances of receiving federal assistance in the future.

**Big picture:** From 2019 to 2024, the amount of fundraisers for natural disasters [jumped](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ul1?mblid=f53407f0c703&mbcid=38247254.4102487&mid=55ab9c4c00053927cd05204998094c31&mbuuid=PqBAe5c1bS3tvTDfxEgD98b1) 90%, according to the platform, as the ballooning cost to cover homes from disasters had insurance companies dropping some residents from policies altogether.*—MM*

Want to watch tennis but think it’d be better with a claymation vibe? The Australian Open may be the Grand Slam for you. Tennis Australia, the governing body of the pro tennis tournament, has been [streaming](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ult?mblid=3a346521c0fd&mbcid=38247254.4102487&mid=55ab9c4c00053927cd05204998094c31&mbuuid=PqBAe5c1bS3tvTDfxEgD98b1) an animated version of its IRL matches on YouTube, opening the game up to a new category of viewers.

The animation mimics real-time movements—it even recreates players’ outfits and, in the case of Daniil Medvedev, their racket-throwing [outbursts](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ulu?mblid=a50a69d0d7f8&mbcid=38247254.4102487&mid=55ab9c4c00053927cd05204998094c31&mbuuid=PqBAe5c1bS3tvTDfxEgD98b1)—and tracks the trajectory of the ball.

**No subscription? No problem.** Animation allows Tennis Australia to show matches online despite having sold away broadcasting rights to various TV channels, bringing the sport to more people who don’t have specific TV subscriptions. It’s also an opportunity for the organization to “captivate a new generation of fans,” following in the tracks of the [NFL](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ulv?mblid=f01534987db5&mbcid=38247254.4102487&mid=55ab9c4c00053927cd05204998094c31&mbuuid=PqBAe5c1bS3tvTDfxEgD98b1) and NHL, which have both used real-time animation during their games in an effort to appeal to young viewers.

**If you thought *Challengers* was peak tennis…**engagement for the tournament is only going up. When Tennis Australia debuted the technology last year, the first four days brought in 140,000 viewers. This year, the number of people watching over that period jumped to 950,000.*—CC*

[Prime number: A big bonus](#)

![Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/eff1a44d853c31abe0c5cee53798e0035141a81e-1500x1000.jpg?w=668&q=70&auto=format)

Try to bring this energy into your annual performance review: Goldman Sachs just gave CEO David Solomon an $80 million [retention bonus](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ul5?mblid=9a7547c311c3&mbcid=38247254.4102487&mid=55ab9c4c00053927cd05204998094c31&mbuuid=PqBAe5c1bS3tvTDfxEgD98b1). And that’s on top of a 26% pay bump that pushed Solomon’s salary to $39 million last year, which is probably enough to make giving up his [DJ side hustle](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ul6?mblid=b51f771d1b8d&mbcid=38247254.4102487&mid=55ab9c4c00053927cd05204998094c31&mbuuid=PqBAe5c1bS3tvTDfxEgD98b1) worth it. The bonus will be paid in stock that will vest in five years.

Goldman also gave its president and COO John Waldron—rumored to be Solomon’s most likely successor in the role—the same 80 million reasons to stay put. The moves signal a vote of confidence in its leadership team from Goldman’s board two days after the investment bank announced it had doubled profits for the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the year before. The bank’s stock is up nearly 175% since Solomon took the top job in 2018, but he wasn’t always Goldman’s golden boy—he also oversaw some rough years as the storied investment bank tried to lean into the consumer side.*—AR*

The bad news: It’s going to be freezing outside. A polar vortex will hit a big chunk of the US starting this weekend, sending temperatures plummeting to below zero for over 120 million people, which is more than a third of the US population. It’s also sending Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration inside. With temps in Washington, DC, expected to be in the low-20s on Monday (the coldest Inauguration Day in 40 years), Trump announced his inauguration ceremony will take place in the Capitol Rotunda.</p>

<p style="line-height:22px;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:15px">Today and today only, there is no such thing as scrolling for way too long. Yesterday, the Supreme Court <a href="https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ulk?mblid=6df2d436f615&amp;mbcid=38247254.4102487&amp;mid=55ab9c4c00053927cd05204998094c31&amp;mbuuid=PqBAe5c1bS3tvTDfxEgD98b1" style="border-bottom:2px solid #1c7ff2;text-decoration:none;color:#333" target="\_blank">rejected</a> TikTok’s legal challenge to its impending banishment from US phone screens. That means you might not be able to access your favorite app as soon as tomorrow—temporarily, at least.</p>
<p style="line-height:22px;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:15px"><strong style="color:#000">The decision was unanimous:</strong> The bipartisan TikTok ban that President Joe Biden signed into law in April is constitutional, SCOTUS <a href="https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ull?mblid=6f2e16150b57&amp;mbcid=38247254.4102487&amp;mid=55ab9c4c00053927cd05204998094c31&amp;mbuuid=PqBAe5c1bS3tvTDfxEgD98b1" style="border-bottom:2px solid #1c7ff2;text-decoration:none;color:#333" target="\_blank">ruled</a>, as expected. The court found that “well-supported” national-security <a href="https://links.morningbrew.com/c/tYT?mblid=8d8b4aa33aa2&amp;mbcid=38247254.4102487&amp;mid=55ab9c4c00053927cd05204998094c31&amp;mbuuid=PqBAe5c1bS3tvTDfxEgD98b1" style="border-bottom:2px solid #1c7ff2;text-decoration:none;color:#333" target="\_blank">concerns</a> over alleged Chinese data collection via TikTok’s owner ByteDance take priority over the free speech rights of the app’s 170 million American users.</p>
<h2 style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:19px;font-weight:700;color:#000;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:15px;margin-right:0;margin-left:0">But your FYP could still be saved</h2>
<p style="line-height:22px;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:15px">The Biden administration has signaled that it won’t actually enforce the TikTok ban when it officially kicks in on Jan. 19. The baton will pass to President-elect Trump on Jan. 20, and he’s done a 180 on TikTok since his first term, when he initiated the push for a ban.</p>
<p style="line-height:22px;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:15px"><strong style="color:#000">Trump wants to keep TikTok accessible in the US…somehow.</strong> He said he had a “good” call with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok yesterday. Once in office, Trump could…</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p style="line-height:22px;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:15px"><strong style="color:#000">As for a potential sale…</strong>TikTok has denied reports that Chinese officials are considering selling the app to Elon Musk. Without a deal on the table, TikTok intends to keep its offices open, but plans to shut down services in the US, which would also remove liability risks for app distributors Apple and Google. To keep TikTok on our screens, Trump might need to convince Big Tech that his administration won’t collect the enormous penalties that app stores could legally get hit with if they keep carrying TikTok.<em>—ML</em></p>

The bonus will be paid in stock that will vest in five years.</p>
<p style="line-height:22px;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:15px">Goldman also gave its president and COO John Waldron—rumored to be Solomon’s most likely successor in the role—the same 80 million reasons to stay put. The moves signal a vote of confidence in its leadership team from Goldman’s board two days after the investment bank announced it had doubled profits for the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the year before. The bank’s stock is up nearly 175% since Solomon took the top job in 2018, but he wasn’t always Goldman’s golden boy—he also oversaw some rough years as the storied investment bank tried to lean into the consumer side.<em>—AR</em></p>
