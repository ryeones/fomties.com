## Full Document
if I could go back in time and change one thing about what I was doing for productivity it would be to stick to one note-taking app instead I jumped around from app to app I went to Evernote to obsidian to notion and I thought that if I just changed my app I would become more productive however the opposite happened I was stuck watching tutorials on how to get started on notion for three plus years before it finally got to me that I needed to stick to one 

note-taking app in order to become more productive think about it like this if you're changing an app you're also changing your digital workspace it's like if you were moving from house to house every few weeks it doesn't make sense and it's definitely not helping you become more productive whatever that means growing up my parents always used to get mad at me for forgetting things my brain was kind of like a sieve and it forgot information really easily so I knew I needed a note-taking system to help me get on my my feet but before I 

did that I didn't realize that I needed to change something about myself in order to use those note-taking apps properly in this video I want to explain to you that Apple notes is the app that you should be using for all your note-taking needs and how it can help you in the long run when you're first starting it can be daunting to choose a note-taking app what app are you going to choose largely this is dictated by the Paradox of choice as Barry Schwartz a psychologist from Swarthmore College explains 

learning to choose is hard learning to choose well is harder and learning to choose well in a world of unlimited possibilities is harder still perhaps too hard the good part about Apple notes was for me it was the default choice on all of my devices I use the Apple ecosystem so I had the Mac the iPhone the iPad and the iWatch so I didn't really need to migrate any of my notes anywhere to top it all off you can even use Apple notes on your Windows desktop on icloud.com so I really didn't need to 

switch because it was available on all of my devices anytime that I needed it any system which starts up has to be simple or else no other complexity can be built on top of it the same goes for your note-taking system as John Gall a pediatrician in the 20th Century who had a side hustle for studying how systems function as a whole had this to say about simple systems a complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that works 

the inverse proposition also appears to be true a complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be made to work if you're trying to add multiple apps to a productivity system it's never going to work if it's too complex you're never actually going to do it seeing others with a complex workflow may feel like you need to have a complex workflow as well to keep up with them however this can't be further from the truth if I was to get the same shoes car and lifestyle that LeBron James has I wouldn't be LeBron James for the simple 

fact that I can't do what LeBron does on the court and off the court in the same way that he does it the way that I organize my notes when I was starting out was that I had one note called things to do and based on that note I put everything in it everything that I was consuming everything that I needed to do when on that particular note all of the blogs the podcasts the movies the videos the articles that I needed to read my work emails my personal emails everything went into that note then 

after looking at it again I realized that they split into categories it went my tasks so I put that in things to do then I made two other notes called life buckets and interests and I put the things that were relevant to my health or productivity or car payments or anything that needed to go around my life in the life buckets note and then in the interest note I put all of the things that I wanted to do but I have never gotten around so all of the things that I was going to read I put into the 

interest bucket so things that were areas that I needed to do more research on for example if I was interested in the productivity system for note-taking I would put an article that I had read from Ali abdal or someone else into that particular note then I used this note taking system for 30 days and this was the most important part I did it without changing or without editing this workflow this is what I needed to form a habit you don't need to do exactly what 

I did but you need to have one place where you're capturing everything in order to then delegate and make complexity along with the simple tactic that you used at the beginning in order to truly make a very formidable productivity system principle 2 don't shift around like I said before switching apps comes at a cost it's like moving from one place to another it's not easy and you're probably going to lose some things along the way also when you're coming to a new app you're 

probably dealing with an unfamiliar interface and new buttons that you're gonna have to adjust to when you need to add tasks or remove tasks so it makes it very hard to switch this comes to a head when people are forced to choose a productivity app there's so many that it's hard to choose so you look at your favorite productivity Guru and you you choose what he's using until the next video when he comes out with another app and a few weeks later you want to switch to that one but knowing what I've just told you that comes at a cost and this 

cost is readily apparent when you go through the new app and you're not able to find any of the things that you need to in your previous app and you just saw it in defeat saying that it's not for you as author Greg McKeon explains in his book essentialism psychologists call this decision fatigue the more choices we are forced to make the more the quality of our decisions deteriorates switching apps comes with a cost of losing features that you loved in the previous app and porting over to the new 

app and straddling the two trying to keep features that you love from both and this breeds indecision about which app you're going to continue to use in the future this happened to me when I was using Evernote and todoist in the same month and I couldn't remember where I put my tasks on my list in todoist or my list in Evernote and needless to say I got nothing done that month because I didn't know where my tasks were so I didn't know what I needed to complete principle three why Apple notes I like Apple notes because of its user-friendly 

features and it does everything that you needed to do out of a note-taking app I needed to sync between many different devices from my phone to my laptop to my tablet and my watch and it does that seamlessly without me even thinking about it I've never had it once crash on me in all of my time using it and I've been using it for over two years I can also use Siri to jot down a quick note while I'm driving riding my bike or even taking a shower I can use Command Center to write down a quick note when I'm thinking by pulling down Command Center hitting the quick note button and just 

jotting down my thoughts one of the best and underutilized features of Apple notes is the ability to scan documents and then later upload them to Dropbox this has been a lifesaver for work in school because I'm able to quickly scan a document and then upload it to my Dropbox and send it to whoever I need to just with a tap of a button and also it's searchable because it has OCR text attached to it Apple notes also allows me to share my notes to family and friends so that we can collaborate this has been especially useful when I'm trying to plan trips with them in order 

to update them in real time on things that we need to pack Apple notes has everything you want in a note-taking app and it's really helpful for me because it helps me write down my tasks into something actionable because then I can act on it and do it in a realistic amount of time rather than just spending time organizing my to-do's which I did with all of the other apps that I had David Allen in his legendary book getting things done write this use your mind to think about things rather than think of them you want to be adding 

value as you think about projects and people not simply reminding yourselves they exist you are the captain of your own ship the more you act from that perspective the better things will go for you understanding that our approach to productivity may be different than others is important I'm not suggest suggesting that you have to use Apple notes but it is a good starting point if you're looking for something simple and effective principle 4 take action now I want you to open your notes app right now and start taking stock of all of the 

tasks that you have to do this may seem hard because your life is spread across all different apps but taking action is the first step to getting that under control this step will be really informative because it'll allow you to take steps on the things that matter and forget about the things that you don't want to remember writing things down and taking it out of your brain and into Apple notes will be really beneficial because you know that you can just search Apple notes to remember the things you do and it'll lower your Baseline levels of stress remembering 

that you need to do something but you don't actually remember what the task is that you need to do then separate all your tasks after this day what went well what went bad and remember if you just don't want to keep some of the items you can always delete it the cool thing about this is that you don't need to tag or put into organizing folders you can just copy and paste text wherever you want to put them if you want to make another note with all of your tasks that are for a specific project you can do that and you don't need to worry about 

color coding or adjusting text or anything it's all the same text because it's Apple notes the most important thing that we need to realize is that productivity apps are not just a way that we figure out what we need to do but it's about what we choose to do as Viktor Frankel explains in his novel man search for meaning man does not simply exist but always decide what his existence will be what he will become in the next moment live as if you are living the second time and acted as 

wrongly the first time as you are about to act now if we're not being mindful of the way we work then we're going to be a slave to our task if we don't take action now then we're always going to be pushing off the things we want to do to later time is the best resource that we have and productivity apps are just a vessel if you're not being mindful of your time then you're just going to waste it and it's not going to work out for you my solution for this was Apple notes because it allowed me to focus on my life and not the never-ending stress and deadlines that come from school or work 

if there's one thing that you take away from this video it's that the cost of switching apps is tremendous and just focusing on actionable tasks and not the app itself will make your life much more fulfilling and your tasks much easier to complete thanks for watching the video if you're interested in more content here's a video of me living like Ali abdal for a week thanks again and see you in the next one
