## Full Document
Hello everyone,

so far I've been using Hashtags as followed, e.g.: #idea, #method, #concept,...

So basically as an overlying classification for contents I don't deem sensible to be connected via a linked note. Like, there's no point for me to connect every idea to one big [[idea]], for example.

Does anyone have a completely different way of using them? I'd really love to know and maybe integrate it into my own workflow to some degree!

Best regards
