Now if you’re new to the channel and you want actionable tips on branding, strategy, anddesign,then smash that subscribe button and hit the notification bell as well.My name is Arek Dvornechuck and at Ebaqdesign, my mission is to help people design iconicbrands.

Okay, so before I show you these brand strategy examples,first, let’s quickly define what a brand strategy actually is and why it’s importantfor branding a business.

So, what is a brand strategy?When it comes to this subject, Marty Neumeier is a true brand strategist.And this is how he defines brand strategy:“A plan for the systematic development of a brand in order to meet business objectives.”— Marty Neumeier, Brand Gap.

The goal of brand strategy is to shape the perceptions of a brand’s audience so thatultimately we can influence them.Therefore, the brand strategy sets out the plan for shaping those perceptions throughdifferent forms of expression, both visual and verbal.

Brand strategy used to be reserved for global brands, but now more business ownersare starting to realize the importance of buildinga brand and the strategy behind it.

So in this video, I examine some of the world’s greatest organizations and reverse-engineerTheir greatness.

So that you can understand the strategic decision they’ve made in the past that allowed themto grow and build iconic brands that they are today.Now, before we talk about those specific examples, it’s also important to define key elementsof an effective brand strategy.So, you see branding experts go about defining brands in different ways and by using a varietyof frameworks, but most of them would definitely agree on these key elements...That I believe every successful brand strategy must include:Purpose, Vision, Values, Positioning, Personality, Voice, Tagline.So now I will show you an example of a famous brand for each of those 7 key brand strategyelements.And when you look through these seven examples — please look for opportunities to not copybut just to understand the concept behind it so that you can apply it for your own use.

And then, I will give you my step-by-step process to developing a brand strategy foryours, or your client’s brand — so stick around.Ok, so without further ado, let’s jump right into the first and probably the most importantelement of your brand strategy,which is your Brand Purpose, and here let’s take Tesla as an example.1.Tesla — Brand Purpose.Now the goal of a brand’s purpose is to define the greater good behind your work andtalk about itin order to rally your team and foster connection with your audience.

So your brand’s purpose is expressed by your purpose statement,which is a short sentence describing the WHY behind your work as a brand.“Why does your company exist?Why did you get out of bed this morning?And why should anyone care?”So Tesla is a great example of a purpose-driven brand.Now, Tesla was founded in 2003 by a group of engineers who wanted to prove that peopleTesla didn’t need to compromise to drive electric cars.

Now, Tesla believes in clean, sustainable energy and saving our planet.So the Tesla’s brand purpose statement is the following: “To accelerate the world’stransition to sustainable energy.”Which is a great way to go about your brand purpose — to tie the brand to a greatercause like saving our planet, helping people or animals.So Tesla believes that electric vehicles can be better, quicker, and more fun to drive thangasoline cars.But today, Tesla builds not only all-electric vehicles but also infinitely scalable cleanenergy generation and storage solutions.So as you can learn from this example, your purpose statement should be open for futureexpansion.So Tesla’s purpose statement doesn’t focus on just cars specifically, but it’s aboutsomething bigger.It believes in general that the faster the world stops relying on fossil fuels and movestowards a zero-emission future, the better.And this can be manifested through electric cars, but also other products like storage and cleanenergy solutions.

So, to sum up — the brand purpose will inspire your employees to come to work and give yourcustomers a clear reason why they should engage with your brand.So that ultimately your brand can play an invaluable, irreplaceable role in people’slives.Now let’s talk about Brand Vision by taking Starbucks as an example.Now the goal of a brand’s vision is to ensure that the brand is navigated towards the rightdirection.And your brand’s vision is expressed by your Vision Statement — which is a one-sentencestatement describing the clear and inspirational long-term desired end-state.So you need to describe the future your brand is ultimately working towards.And this will inspire and energize your staff,but also help you dream big and influence long-term business decisions.

Now, this is how Starbucks thinks of the future position as a business they want to be in:“To be the premier purveyor of the finest coffee in the world.”Starbucks' vision statement is probably why the multi-million dollar coffeehouse chainhas soared to success.After carefully examining Starbucks' vision statement,it’s clear that they have an ambitious goal to become the finest coffee maker in theworld.If you have a clear vision of where your brand is heading, then you can make meaningful decisionsalong the way.So you need to describe the future your brand is ultimately working towards.Your vision statement will help you get some clarity on where you’re heading asa brand.It will help you think more strategically and make meaningful decisions that are “onbrand.”Now let’s talk about Brand Values by taking Apple as an example.

The goal of your brand’s core values is to ensure that you can create a cultureand driving force for what that brand stands for in the world.And how you want that brand to be perceived in the marketplace.So basically, your core values are guiding principles that articulate what your brandstands for.They must be actionable, so that your staff can act upon them and create that desirableinternal culture.Ultimately, they deliver a consistent brand experience externally — to your customers.

Now, Steve Jobs was also the company’s chief brand evangelist who used to say:“Marketing is about values.It’s a complicated and noisy world,and we’re not going to get a chance to get people to remember much about us.”So Apple’s Core Values are the following:Accessibility — Ensure people with physical limitations are not left out.Education — Provide educational solutions to schools across the United States.

Environment — Build products that are safe for both the users and the environment.Inclusion and diversity — To create products that serve everyone, we believe in including everyone.Supplier responsibility — Hold suppliers and partners responsible for creating quality products for our users.Privacy — Offer the utmost security for the user.Privacy is a fundamental human right.So, if you’re a founder and you’re not clear about what your brand stands for, then how can you expect others to know?So you see, you need to be like Steve Jobs and also be your own chief brand evangelist.

So to sum up — your values stand at the very core of your brand and they guide business processes.And together with your purpose and vision statements, they guide your company both internally and externally.And they’re important to both — attracting customers as well as retaining your best employees.

Now let’s talk about Brand Positioning by taking Amazon as an example.Now, the goal of a brand’s positioning is to find that differentiator and set your brand apart from your competitors.And as Al Ries said, “Positioning is not what you do to a product; it is what you do to the mind of a prospect.”So you need to find that differentiator to be able to stand out in the marketplace and stand for something in the minds of your customers.So that your audience can remember you for something you want to be known for.

Now, when you think of Amazon, what comes to your mind?Probably you love that quick delivery and excellent customer service.So Amazon’s Positioning Statement is the following:For consumers who want to purchase a wide range of products online with quick delivery, Amazon provides a one-stop online shopping site.Amazon sets itself apart from other online retailers with its customer obsession, passion for innovation, and commitment to operational excellence.

Now, as a business, you can do many different things, but as a brand — you want to beknown for just ONE thing — not one product or one service, but one idea.So that ultimately, you can create that desirable perception and take a specific place in themind of your customer.So next time they’re about to make a purchasing decision, it can help them navigate througha variety of choices and buy from you thanks to that clear positioning.

Now let’s talk about Brand Personality by taking Harley as an example.The goal of a brand’s personality is to give a human side to your brand,so that your target audience can build a lasting relationship with your brand as if it werea person.Because you see, certain personalities attract each other, and others repel each other.So you want to create that human-like persona that will attract your target audience andconnect with them on an emotional level.Now, the personality of Harley Davidson is ruggedness, which fits the Outlaw archetype.So you see, a brand you choose is often a vehicle to express yourself.Harley-Davidson has a macho, rebellious, America-loving, freedom-seeking personality.This personality directs all the visual as well as verbal communication.And you can see that conveyed in all brand touchpoints, like in marketing campaigns,for example.

So ultimately, having a well-defined brand personality will help make that brand-customerconnection as if they were interacting with a real human being.Now let’s talk about Brand Voice by taking Tiffany as an example.The goal of a brand’s voice is to set the guidelines for how you want your brandto sound to others.Which is basically how the personality of your brand comes through the words that youuse in communication.So that your brand’s voice is essentially an extension of your brand personality.And it helps you develop a consistent way of conveying your message to your audience.Now, Tiffany is not just about the shade of baby blue, but it’s also about their welldefined brand personality and brand voice.

So, The Tiffany’s tone of voice is witty, elegant, and classic.Now, the content and social teams work together for voice consistency between social postsand branded content.“Historically, Tiffany’s voice as a brand was witty, and Twitter allows us to bring thatback,” said Hong, who leads the team of art directors and copywriters.So, Tiffany has a clearly defined brand voice and is big on social media and marketing.After all, people are willing to pay much more for a Tiffany product than some equivalentwithout a Tiffany logo.So, they pay for the logo, design, and the small blue box that holds the jewelry.But it wouldn’t be possible to sell those often overpriced products without proper toneof voice and messaging.

So, in every single communication, the Tiffany’s brand voice is very elegant and classic.And the brand became iconic in a big part thanks to consistent branding with the toneof voice that resonates well with their customers.So, to sum up — your personality and your voice will work together,to represent the HOW — how your message is delivered.And your brand’s tone of voice should be used consistently across all channels of communication.To allow the audience to build that strong human-like connection.

Now, finally, let’s talk about Brand Tagline, and here let’s take Nike as an example.Now, the goal of a brand’s tagline is to convey the brand’s spirit in the shortestway possible.⁣So basically, you need to distill your message to a selection of a few very concise and memorablewords that tell the story of your brand.And your brand tagline should be inspired by your positioning, which is for internalpurposes only.While a tagline is for external purposes — it's customer-facing.

So, in just a few words, you’re expected to grasp the vibe of your brand.⁣So that Nike’s positioning is perfectly manifested to the outside world by theirrenowned tagline — “Just Do It.”Which translates into a brand message that is able to inspire and bond customers to theNike brand.

The Nike's "Just do it" slogan was created 30 years ago by renowned advertising agencyWieden + Kennedy, and it's still one of the core components of Nike's brand today.By featuring numerous notable athletes together with that brand slogan,Nike is able to attract customers and create the desirable perception.

To sum up, we need to define what we want our audience to remember us for,and giving them an easy-to-remember tagline is key to helping them remember your brand.Ok, so this was the last example on my list.I gave you 7 examples of strategies behind famous brands.You see, the world's most successful companies develop brand strategies that inform everythingfrom product development to customer service to sales, marketing, and beyond.

At Ebaqdesign, we look at developing brand strategy as the key step in the process ofbrand building.Many of my clients come to me for a logo or a brand identity system, but whatthey really want is to build a strong brand.Building a strong brand always starts with developing a brand strategy first.

That good strategy combined with great creativity will give your brand a fightingchancein this cluttered and hyper-competitive world.This brand strategy sets the foundationand further informs all your visual and verbal communication in order to help you build a brand that has the potential to become iconic.

Now, how to develop a brand strategy?If you want to build a strong brand that people love, you need to clearly define allkey components of your brand strategy.You should run a workshop with yours or your client’s team to define allthose key brand strategy elements.

How do you do that? You simply run branding exercises to align stakeholders onthe same page and clarity on those key aspects of strategy.Everything you need to run this workshop effectively can be found onMy blog is where I share with you how to run each and every single branding exercise step-by-step.
