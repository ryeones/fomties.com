this blueprint works because I've used it on my own personal brand which has brought me four profitable companies an audience of over 2 million people and a portfolio of online businesses that generates over $13.8 million of Revenue a year and the best news is I documented analyzed and packaged every step of the process to create this personal brand system that you can use to do the same it all comes down to Five Pillars your brand system compounding content 

audience growth systems monetization moments and a core Team all buildable and doable within the next 30 days after you finish watching this video and subscribing to this [Music] channel number one brand system your brand is what people say about you when you're not in the room whether you know it or not you have a personal brand the question is are you intentionally growing it are you comfortable with how you portray yourself online are you 

intentionally leveraging your personal brand to grow your business we are all brands and you own 100% of it so how do you create a personal brand that is a magnet for your dream customer you need to get clear on your vision your mission your values goals target market content categories content IP and content ideas what is your one sentence statement that outlines what your company does why it does it and how it gets it done my mission with found 

is to help over a 100 million entrepreneurs accomplish their dreams through proven systems your values determine the tone voice and personality that you're going to have online from there you want to determine who you are looking to Target and then be specific at foundos I Target high growth Founders that are looking to go from Seven figures to eight figures to exit through proven systems so now that you know exactly who you want to Target you want to get outside the building and actually go in speak to these people survey them 

ask them questions talk to them understand what is your biggest challenge what are your biggest aspirations what are your questions when it comes to the space or industry that you operate in if you could wave some magic wand what would be the biggest accomplishment you would hope to achieve this year the answers to these questions are going to help you then formulate content ideas that are going to serve your dream customer now that you're clear on who your target market is you want to come up with your four content categories content categories are the 

drum beat of your marketing right these are the things that people are going to come to know and love you for they identify the general themes you want to talk about online my content categories are audience growth systems personal stories content creation systems and scaling these are the things people come back to me for again and again go and get a pen and paper out and write down your four content categories now that you have your categories nailed down I want to cover a little known but highly 

impactful secret it's called content [Music] IP casy neistat's sunglasses Daniel dal's thumbnails Peter McKinnon's what's up what's up everybody Peter McKinnon here they are trained elements that consistently are woven into every piece of content associated with their personal Brands as you grow your brand audience and offer developing unique phrasing and language is essential when you create unique names for your 

processes you own those processes you want to Define your core ideas and a bonus if you can think of a group of words that you want to be associated with online for me it's systems audience growth and organic content funnels what values or principles are consistently present in your story create a short list of principles that best capture your identity often you'll find certain terms or Expressions that you use often even ones that you've invented you're going to look for these defining terms terms that you can use across multiple 

Concepts or categories for instance at founder OS we focus on operating systems so it's only natural that when I go and create different lessons or titles for different concepts that I use the word OS the combination of the words sentences and phrases that you own creates your own content IP this universe of content that you can become known for online a little test that you know if you have your content IP down and effective is people are going to 

start actually copying you online but don't worry no one is you and your personal brand is safe as long as you remain consistent and this is where compounding content and my content waterfall system come into play if you build it they will come might be a great strategy for a baseball stadium but it is terrible advice for anyone trying to build an audience to get attention you need to be in front of your ideal audience and regularly I 

recommend picking two social media platforms to begin with and committing to publishing two times daily it's better to be the best on two platforms than mediocre on five let's pick a channel with low barrier to entry you don't want to have to buy a camera expensive gear or pay for extra tools to get started and trying things out pick a channel where you feel comfortable where you can get writing immediately my top two recommendations for your first channel to grow on are X and Linkedin these are the Grand Slam platforms they 

use written text which means that you can just make it yourself and start practicing your copywriting immediately lastly you want to implement the most powerful content system in the world my content waterfall system building a brand and growing an audience of Raving fans is key for achieving both with your business and 

revenue goals however there's a classic catch22 that comes into play to build and sustain a personal brand you have to post engaging content daily across multiple platforms and anyone that tells you differently is either getting lucky or just lying to you the answer lies in implementing A system that maximizes output while minimizing effort I call it the content waterfall system the foundation of the content waterfall system lies in creating a pillar piece of content imagine this cascading 

waterfall right the pillar piece of content is the source of the waterfall and the subsequent content pieces are the streams that Branch out from it this could be a blog post an X thread a podcast episode a YouTube long form video any piece of content that offers value that can be broken down into smaller pieces I use an xread as the pillar piece of content this idea and the copy from that xread becomes 

inspiration for 10 more short form tweets they become content like three principles I live by how to start a business from nothing seven marketing metrics building an audience writing online how to deal with being unfocused and going for a run nature is the greatest Mentor applying the 8020 rule to everything and if you want freedom build systems and outcomes fall in love with the process the same idea from the xred becomes three short form animated videos this adds 12 additional 

posts to the content waterfall so now we're at the xred plus 12 video posts and 12 short form tweets the short form animated video also becomes a tweet as seen here the same video becomes a short form talking head video as you can see right here and this goes out on Instagram YouTube shorts Tik Tok and X that's four more so now we're at 26 posts the lessons I share in the original X thread also become pieces of this YouTube script that was around how 

I went from 15K in debt to $8.7 million a year and it becomes a newsletter now a month later so that's 28 it also becomes a long form LinkedIn post and an Instagram Carousel so now we're at 29 posts and a b-roll video on Instagram that's 30 you can use this chart below to map out all the content you want to make from that one X red or long form piece of content and turn it into 25 other pieces of content focus on cont content that inspires educates 

entertains makes people think and triggers some sort of emotion if you're looking to come up with a 100 content ideas in just 30 minutes I'd recommend using my content idea [Music] machine let me go and show you this content idea machine prompt for chat gbt heads up this thing's a beast The Prompt reads like this you are a viral content expert I need your help generating compelling content ideas take 

inspiration from viral YouTube video ideas and viral Twitter threads with over 5 million views make the copywriting impeccable and memorable and then what you're going to do is then replace this info below with your own overview of your mission for your own brand I have here I'm a Founder creating content to help Founders reach $5 million per year through proven systems for audience brand and Community growth our mission is to help a 100 million Founders automate their business and hit five $ million profit a year I want to 

generate viral content ideas by creating a table in the table the x-axis has content groups meaning ways to present a Content category and the y axis has content categories to be matched with the xaxis the x-axis has content groups formatted the following way and then it gets into the ways to format this right so it's going to have one educational content like lists best ofs tools facts guides systems summaries and Frameworks the second area is going to the emotional it's going to drive some type of emotion and get the reader to feel 

some type of way that caused them to share with five friends the third is deep dive so data math reasons Trends expert quotes research and Industry breakdowns the fourth reflection so hidden secrets lessons mistakes successful routines personal experiences and advice to yourself 5 years ago the fifth is vulnerable so failures obstacles insecurities skills you want to learn what things shape you what things you wish you knew in the best advice you were given six is edutainment so you're going to 

create content with amazing storytelling practical value that is captivating compelling and makes people want to share it with five friends and then seven is lists so provide useful lessons steps systems processes tools and resources about the content category so the Y AIS is going to contain the content category so these are the ones that you went and wrote down earlier in this video mine as an example are number one $5 million founder systems two automating your business three controlling the four W's which is to 

work on what you want when you want where you want and with who you want and four Community Building let's see what this thing generates here you can see it now going and generating a table with viral content ideas in each cell of the X and Y AIS so it's going down all of those different content types and then in each of those categories that I went and formulated like $5 million founder systems automating your business controlling the 4ws and community building it's generating me a table of 

ideas for each of those areas so pretty freaking powerful if you want a copy of that prompt in my content machine template you can get it for free via the link in the description there's a lot of value them there so you're going to want to go check it [Music] out now let's move on to pillar number three audience growth systems consistency is key put in the Reps and if you are consistent good things will happen I promise you but it's hard to be 

consistent if you don't have the right system in place the only way to Excellence is first through repetition and I recommend that as you build your personal brand online you batch your content creation this is key create 15 videos in one day write 20 pieces of content in 2 hours this will help you avoid Creator burnout and it's going to get you off the content hamster wheel you don't want to be dreading having to create content every every single morning that gets exhausting batch your 

content creation to achieve time freedom from there you're going to schedule your content so you can grow on autopilot and build your audience while you sleep here's a breakdown of all the tech that I use across founder OS hype Fury to schedule X content tweet Hunter X to find inspiration for X content X analytics for X stats Tapo for LinkedIn analytics Tapo X for LinkedIn inspo convert kit for our newsletter School to for the founder OS Community stripe for 

payments web flow for our website at first I was using kajabi though testimonial. to collect testimonials notion for my company Wiki which houses all of the systems across founder OS Google Drive for things like photos videos and b-roll Google docs to document all of our systems zapier for automations figma for designs loom for screen recordings and I also use this to reduce my meetings type form for a 

Founder OS application to get feedback from Founders and a sauna for project management to maximize your audience growth follow the data after you've been consistently posting for a little while it's important to take some time and look over your data you're going to want to see Trends around what's working and what's not you're going to see what really resonates with your audience you're going to double down on what's working and do less of what isn't execute optimize repeat 

number four monetization moments monetizing your personal brand is essential so you can reinvest into people product and your vision monetization moments are a crucial element of your organic content strategy they guide your audience to take specific steps such as subscribing sharing or purchasing ctas or call the actions are the best way to drive people from your social audience to customers think of your audience as this vast ocean of attention Okay and your ctas 

are like this net that's going to help catch the fish and then drive them to revenue the key is to strategically place the ctas in your content and ensure that you do them in a way that fits the subject of the content that they're in what do you need to scale from just a personal brand you need to build a core team you don't just want to have a personal brand right you want to have a personal Media Company the personal Media company is nothing new it's been 

used for ages to build the world's biggest companies Benjamin Franklin owned and published the Pennsylvania Gazette to influence public opinion and it became his personal Media Company Jeff Bezos bought the Washington Post to have his personal Media company and Elon Musk bought X to have his personal Media Company the difference between you and these folks is this you don't need to buy a media company you can become the media company picture this you own a 

personal Media company that grows everything around you it drives attention to your products and companies it brings you a flood of new customers cash flow and opportunities and it attracts top talent so you no longer need to chase people it is a beacon for your people creatives dreamers investors Builders Founders and innovators you build a community of people online you grow your digital reputation and you become known and respected this is the 

power of your personal Media Company infinite leverage at your fingertips and to scale a personal Media Company you need to build a team of weapons weapon an individual who when brought onto a company has the ability to 10x their area they go above and beyond to fulfill the needs of the company and the mission they hire more weapons and elevate your culture and speed of innovation here are the areas where weapons can help you in 

your business Tech sales video photos design writing funnels animations operations video editing and social posting in the last 20 months I grew an audience of over 2 million people around my personal brand I haven't done this alone though I've had an incredible team around me here's my or chart from founder OS but you don't need all of these folks to get started over time time you're going to likely build a team 

such as a social manager to post all your content a writer to help you craft your content a video editor to edit your videos and a videographer to then shoot your content these four weapons can do damage this is the profitable personal brand Playbook if you want more systems to grow an audience to 1.8 million just like I did check out this video on my system to get your first 100,000 followers so if you enjoyed this video you're going to love my next video so be
