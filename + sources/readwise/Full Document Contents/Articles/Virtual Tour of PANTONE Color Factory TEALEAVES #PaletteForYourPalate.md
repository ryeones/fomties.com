## Full Document
[Music] Pantone is proud to be a company still Manufacturing in the United States um the thing that we are really strong and really uh good at is color management and color development and the development in selecting the right color so we spent a lot of time and effort maintaining color throughout the process uh even during the printing and binder process and production of these Graphics guides the color will probably be looked 

at an average of 20 to 30 times in the creation of our fashion and home books it may be 40 to 50 times all of that requires very very good Focus talented employees lots of training and experience and it's something that would be very very difficult to to Outsource or to do in a commercial environment so we've kept all of our manufacturing here all of our quality control is here all of our planning it also keeps us very much in touch with our customers with our product design and having everything 

in one location really is is what makes Pantone special our ink technicians very very highly trained skilled um we also look at them as somewhat of artists because this is kind of a blend of science and art so what Joe's going to do for us 

here is show how we take the medium the trans white medium we take the specially formulated uh pigment bases that are part of the panone matching system and blend them together to give us a perfectly matched panone color when you're measuring color and maintaining color standards to the level that we do in the Pantone systems um this actually gives us the highest accuracy and the most reproducibility of color one drop more or less than what you're looking 

for has a tremendous impact on the final color that you get on the Press we're going to take the batch that he's mixing and we're going to compare that to what we call a wet standard it's literally ink that we've previously matched and approved and used in a prior production run we're going to draw those two things down side by side and we're going to compare the colors if you can see differences between the two that's not a good thing we want to almost see that it's just one homogeneous color across the stripe both on the um the White and 

the black area as [Music] well when we start bringing in instrumentation the reason for for color measurement instruments is that our eyes are very our perception of color is very subjective and what I see is very difficult to communicate to you so we use instrumentation because it kind of serves as a as a color referee okay it gives us an actual number a quantifiable color difference from a Target that we 

want to achieve and maintain versus what we've produced okay that's called a delta or change in E which is basically for color so we will measure the printed output and compare it back to a Master measurement if you will of the original run and it will give us a quantifiable number of how different that is so one of the great things about Delta e and using instruments for color measurement is that it is kind of a color referee or an objective measurement of color one of the slightly 

negative things about it is that instruments don't see color as well as the human eye so sometimes we could have good Delta e numbers something we're happy with but visually it may have moved in the wrong direction Delta e is a circle around the target so sometimes we can have good numbers but it's an unpleasing to the eye so therefore in our process we require both a digital approval for numbers and an approval by visual assessment 

this is our color standards laboratory which is a very key part of the fashion home system uh what we're doing in this laboratory is they're almost the color police ensuring that each time we produce a new color we always come here for approval whether it is is suitable to go to the next process when we're evaluating color we try to take any surrounding colors out of the equation completely so uh the walls that you see here are being painted gray the inside of the light boost being gray again even 

the white lab coat that we ask our technicians to wear the idea is to remove any of the perception of the surrounding colors uh away from what we're trying to evaluate everything is compared back to a digital reading or color instrumentation reading because that is a a fixed point in time that can never change we use instrumentation in order to use instrumentation properly we need to condition the samples that are going to be evaluated the temperature and hum humidity has a tremendous effect 

on the colorants that are used in both the graphics products as well as the Fashion Home Products we actually find that the color will change significantly based on that we come back to our lab to take variables out of the equation things like water the fabric that we're currently using the batch of D stuffs 

even the processes and the people that are being used now as opposed to the last time that we produce that color we use pieces of equipment like this to make sure that the amounts of D stuff is controlled very closely this is a almost completely Automated machine that not only makes the solutions of the die stuff but dispenses them directly into the dying machines and controls the process so that we can get a predictive result of what that formula will be in dying which is different from other operations 

it takes 6 to 8 hours before you actually get an understanding of what the color is and if you're doing it correctly with cotton and the D stuffs we use you have to wait at least 24 hours to let them naturally regain the moisture that you dry out by drying the fabric so rather than doing a nice draw down like we saw in the print here we actually have to wait 24 hours to know if the formula we chose for the color is even the right color the machines that you see to my left here are called jet dying Mach machines the way that these machines 

work is both the fabric and the bath or the water are being moved constantly okay they're going around in a circle we use these two tanks to inject both the colorant and various chemicals into the process friendly chemicals like soaps and things like that and also we uh use things to adjust the pH so the dying process is all about time and temperature and then using chemistry we form a permanent bond between the Dy stuff and the fiber after the dying process is finished we've completed our soaping and rinsing we're going to take 

the fabric and put it here into our extractor we're trying to remove as much of the water as possible that's been absorbed during the process so we can use less energy in our final drying so they're going to take the fabric this just removed from the extractor they're going to sew it to the previous lot that's already in the machine as you see and they're going to run it through this drying frame very very slowly about 1 to two yards a minute it's just forced hot air being circulated in and around the fabric and that forced hot air drives out any of 

the uh moisture that's left behind from the process finally at the end of this machine we're going to cut a full width strip of fabric from the beginning a window from the middle and then another full width strip from the End of the Roll all three of those will be used in our color evaluation to determine whether or not this rooll meets the panone standard [Music]
