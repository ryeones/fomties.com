take time to exercise take time to care for yourself take time also for the different aspects of Health there's our physical emotional mental and even spiritual health one of the things I've learned is that when we are ill all the money we've earned or work hard to accumulate or save really becomes a very small piece of our life in the sense that it allows us to pay for our 

bills to pay for our medical expenses and also to pay for Peace of Mind especially when our loved ones our family members may be ill saving up for emergencies is important but at the same time what I learned is that in a fast-paced society like ours here in Singapore we can spend so much of our time in working and perhaps even overworking and have we found a way to perhaps enjoy the money we've earned in
