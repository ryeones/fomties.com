## Full Document
I played around with Obsidian for a month or so at a previous internship and enjoyed it, but between my ADHD and lack of discipline from burnout, no productivity tech has ever sticked for me. I suffered the consequences from it and am hoping to make some gradual changes to become a slightly more disciplined learner.
 

**I would like advice on workflows for independent study, especially in regards to actually returning to and digesting what I save?** Additionally, if anyone has **personal recommendations for** phrases to search for, or great books to read **on learning outside of higher education/degree-granting programs**, I would greatly appreciate it!
 

 I am trying to repair my relationship to learning + study after years of burnout trying to get this damn college degree. I left my liberal arts school feeling like I learned a little bit of a lot of things, but fear I know nothing in particular at all. Especially no hard skills for the workforce...Okay on the soft skills though lol.
 

**I struggle with constantly saving things (via screenshots, terrible I know) and NEVER RETURNING TO ANYTHING.** Tried to use Pocket years ago but forgot about it. My main priorities for the items I would like to save are:
 

1. events to attend (almost always Instagram links). Any cool calendar plug-ins or extensions come to mind? It would be nice to be able to have a little directory of all the organizations + art centers + DJs I have interest in checking out so I am not reliant on the absolutely terrible Instagram algorithm.
2. "creative stuff": internet radio stations, visual art to return to, artists to study, the insane laundry list of hobbies i would like to attempt + *\*some\** links from my adhd rabbit hole google searching. I guess I need to learn that *I do not need all the links...*
3. essays. I come across a lot of interesting long-form essays on twitter that get lost in my bookmarks :( i am trying not to become obsessed with archiving everything I consume, but there are some great essays I enjoy re-reading that I would love to have handy!
4. academic syllabi, article pdfs, book notes, etc. I have some familiarity with Zotero from college, but I don't think I ever got close to understanding it's full capabilities.

 I know at the end of the day, the beauty and curse of this world is there is an endless amount of media that we will never be able to consume in our lifetimes. It saddens me, but that is life. I guess it makes the media I do spend time special in the grand scheme of my life. However, I would rate my studying + digital organizational practices at about a 0 right now though. So if I could improve it just a few more points that would be great :)
 

 edited to remove the five uses of "cool" in my original post lol
