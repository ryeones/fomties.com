## Full Document
when I'm organizing files I always split into two different people one is present [Music] me who wants to be able to categorize those files as quickly as possible with minimal effort and the other one is future [Music] me who wants to be able to retrieve those findes as quickly as possible thanks to a very organized 

[Music] system now it's impossible to please both people you need to find a compromise and that's the question that we're going to try and answer today what is that compromise what is the best way to categorize files so when I had to inside my 

organizational style I went through a series of principles principle number one is the organization is very personal it depends on a series of things that we're going to explore later on including your personality you can simply copy what other people do the second principle is that the perfect system does not exist so you need to apply the parto principle here that says that you basically want a system that covers 80% of your needs and the other 20% you accept may not work on occasion and you may have to to step in with some 

additional intervention the third principle is that complexity must be avoided unless it's necessary so start small and then build your system up and increase the complexity only when and if it's needed so with the key principles out of the way these are some questions you need to ask yourself to Define your organizational style question number one is how many files do you need to file the higher the number the higher the organizational effort number two how often do you need to retrieve those 

files if this happens rarely then you can lean towards a more minimalistic organizational style and probably the search function can help you find whatever you need with no effort at all question number three is are your files easy to isolate or Silo you definitely don't want to have files that could belong to several folders next do you share your files and folders if you do then more organization is required to allow them to be able to find your files and then number five in terms of 

personality do you get frustrated if you don't find immediately the things you're looking for the answer to the first two questions creates a matrix like this one on one axis we have the volume of files you need to categorize from low to high and on the other axis we have the retrieval frequency again from rarely to often this creates four situations four quadrants that we can explore starting from the top left one which is when you have um lots of files but you rarely retrieve them in this case you can get 

away with minimal filing effort the second situation which is one level up in terms of filing efforts is the one where you have low number of files that you retrieve rarely in this case you may want to categorize these things for easier retrieval one level up again you go medium filing effort when you have a few files that you retrieve often and then one level up the maximum level of filing effort when you have lots of files you retrieve very often and that is the case where you may want to 

consider having a very complex folder structure in my case I'm on the left side of this graph uh the number of files that I save and store in categories every year is around a thousand probably bit less so definitely not a high number but more importantly I retrieve those files I realized fairly rarely and I think many people fall in this category as well if you if you look at your um hard disk you may discover that the number of files you actually store is fairly low so looking at this Matrix I realized what the perfect organ ational strategy is for me the first 

thing that I do is that I only use one single folder per year I create a folder at the beginning of the year in this case called 2024 in which I store every file that I need to categorize this year I don't use any subfolders unless in very specific circumstances typically when I have a very quick project that will be opened and closed in a matter of days like this YouTube video for example every um piece of video and audio and effects and sounds will be stored in this folder just for one or two days and 

once the video is released I don't open that folder anymore the second thing I did was to Define um a naming convention which I apply very consistently and it's what I call the four W's the four W's are when who what and where when is the date I either received the file or the file was originally created the date is structured in ISO format so starting with the year and then the month and then the day so when I sort my directory they will sort um properly the reason 

why I put a date directly in the file name instead of leveraging the file system you know sourced by date created or date modified and so on is that a it's easy for me to see the date this way but more importantly if I scan a document which is an old document if I scan it today I will still put the date of the document as you know the original date it could be the 1980s whatever maybe it's a very old document I want to store it using that date the second W is 

who and this is the sender of the file the author of the file maybe a client and I don't put anything if the file is originated by me the third W is the what it's a description of what's in the file and it's something that I write using my own words to make sure that my future self will be able to search for something using my natural language and find the file the fourth W is where which is an indication of where we are with this file what what stage we are 

something that other people could call a version for example if you look at these three examples the first file is called 20244 24 so this is April um 2024 the who is the tax Authority who sent me this letter the content the description of of what is inside the file is it's a request to fire tax return and then there is nothing else because there is no stage for this file the second file is from 2024 0912 so September 

of 2024 it is from my accountant and it's about my tax return for 2024 in this case there is a where in this file which is the stage this thing is at which is it's a draft to sign and then the third file um has a date 20241 01 it is a file originated uh created by me so there is no indication of the author but there is an indication of the content and this is the tax return 2024 and the stage is signed in the future I may be looking for a tax return 2024 signed or 

signed tax return or signed 2024 and I will be able to retrieve this specific file the next things to cover are tags and folders so I use tags on occasions not very often but they are useful to group things together and although I accept I'm not going to be very consistent with using uh tags so I know that I will have to manually search for additional things using a tag is a good starting point for example I colate some 

uh everything that could be related to my tax return in the 2024 folder and if I remember to do it I tag this things as tax 2024 as I said I accept the fact that I may not be as consistent as I want but it's going to be an initial uh starting point when at the end of the year I need to send my stuff to my accountant I look for the tag and that's an initial list of files that I will I will send them and then I can search for additional things but that's going to be easier as well because everything will 

be in a single folder called 2024 when it comes down to folders I use very very few folders on many occasions I have no sub folders in my 2024 um folder there are only a few situations where I use sub folders and these are normally when I'm working on a specific time bound project that only takes one or two days like for example this video I'm recording it everything goes into a subfolder specific for this video I'm going to complete the video to tomorrow 

and once I've uploaded the video I'm not going to tou that folder anymore the last thing that I decided was to use the search function very heavily the search function can find things way quicker than I can there is no need for me to Traverse all my uh folder structure or look at maybe 100 or 200 files the search function can really look for it and find it in the blink of an eye plus the search function can actually read inside of document it's not limited to the title to the file name it can actually read inside of PDFs text files 

and so on so it can give me a much better set of results if I'm looking for something so this system works extremely well for me it covers 80% of my needs very well and for the other 20% as I said at the beginning I can compensate with some additional effort if I'm looking for a very tricky file I may spend an hour uh looking for it in my um in my folder structure but I'm happy with this setup because the 80 the efficiency gain that I get from the 80% 

overcompensates whatever I may lose in the other 20% how well does your system work let me know in the comments below for now thank you very much for watching and see you soon
