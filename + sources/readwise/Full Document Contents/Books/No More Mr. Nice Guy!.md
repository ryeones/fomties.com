- Category: #Source/books
- Summary: Nice Guys struggle in adulthood because they follow a flawed childhood belief system that tells them they are "bad" for having needs. This leads them to try harder for approval, often resulting in dissatisfaction in their relationships and careers. Building male friendships can help Nice Guys feel more secure and less dependent on women's approval.
