- Summary: The discounted cash flow (DCF) model helps investors estimate a company's value based on its future cash flows. By forecasting cash flows and accounting for the time value of money, investors can determine if a stock is undervalued. This method allows them to rationalize current stock prices and make informed investment decisions.

> One of the ultimate goals of researching a stock is trying to figure out what the heck it's worth, what you think it should be trading for, or what its intrinsic value is, by estimating some sort of price that you think it's worth. You compare that to what it's currently trading for to determine whether the stock is overvalued or if it's a good buying opportunity.

> There are a number of different methods for trying to get to this number. Multiples is one option that's kind of a quick and dirty approach, but one of the more detailed and defensible approaches is the DCF, or Discounted Cash Flow model.

> The DCF model is only as good as the estimates.
> What you put into it is important, and because a lot of these estimates are going to be based on rough forecasts and assumptions that probably will not pan out in the future, you just shouldn’t put any undue weight on the figure that you end up with through a DCF model.

> discount the cash flows, and we do this to account for the time value of money. Since the longer it takes for us to get the money that we want from the business, the further we should discount this amount, since it’s less attractive than money today; and, to account for the cost of capital.

> Because the interest rate that the company pays to its bondholders is tax deductible, we include this tax factor. Basically, all this is doing is slightly lowering our cost of debt to consider the fact that the money paid towards the bondholders will reduce the company's taxable income. So, on a net basis, it will give us some advantage to having debt versus equity. Now, the return on equity is a bit more of an abstract figure; it's basically whatever investors demand from the company. So, it's whatever we decide it will be, higher or should be higher anyway for higher risk companies, and lower for safer and more mature firms. To estimate this amount, you could start from eight percent as an example and simply adjust to reflect the risk of the cash flows that you're estimating.

> For the stock today, in fact, a lot of analysts will do some sort of sensitivity analysis where they show the output of the model under different assumptions, which is a great practice for providing a good range of values to compare to the current stock price and see whether the stock is fairly priced, overvalued, or an undervalued buying opportunity.

I hope you found some value in this video. Obviously, it was a higher level overview of the DCF, but as you can imagine, it would take some time to go through all the different variables and how they can be forecasted and estimated. But as mentioned, if there is interest in me going through an example in a future video, please do let me know in the comment section down below, as well as any feedback you have for the video. As always, thank you for joining me today. Go value with stock or not.
