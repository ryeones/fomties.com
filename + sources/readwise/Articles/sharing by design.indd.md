- Summary: This book explores how to design sharing systems in cities by addressing two key questions: how to create these systems and what knowledge is needed for their design. It identifies two main paradigms of sharing: 'design by capital' and 'design by commoning,' and emphasizes the importance of a systems approach in guiding effective sharing practices. The authors argue that by understanding and specifying the components of sharing systems, we can enhance the ideal of sharing and resolve disagreements about it.

> But being a shared system does not mean that it has been designed to motivate direct or purposeful sharing between people. In other words, a shared system has been primarily designed to optimize access or participation; it does not follow from this that individuals here would prefer to share, or are motivated to share, the common resource using more effective and efﬁcient ways.

> This is seen, for instance, in the prefer- ence to avoid trafﬁc jams, or the preference for a more hygienic public pool. The counter-preference for not sharing is ever present even within a shared system. For this reason, a shared system is not yet a sharing system.

> What then is a sharing system? As discussed in Chap. 1, a sharing system is the outcome of design. Following Boulding’s (1956) seminal taxonomy of systems, a sharing system can be deﬁned as a hybrid social system with the characteristics of an open system. Speciﬁcally, a sharing system is a social system composed of individuals acting in concert (Banathy 1996: 14). This action then enables the self- maintenanceand also the self-reproduction ofthe sharing system. This sharing system is also a teleological, or goal-seeking entity (Churchman 1971), comprising other interconnected social and technological components interacting in an organized way to achieve this goal (Meadows 2008). Therefore, a sharing system is a formation made up of interconnected socio-technical components working toward the goal of reinforcing and reproducing more robust sharing behaviors and practices.

> This goal can be further speciﬁed in the following three ways: First, a sharing system aims to motivate sharing behaviors by developing more effective or efﬁcient,

> Second, a sharing system, through the interaction of its components, provides clear and accountable relational procedures—rules, norms, and institutions—to support and sustain persistent sharing relations.On this, a sharing system aims to normalize sharing relations without calcifying them. Individuals would be accustomed to share in a sharing system, but they are neither expected, nor obliged, to share all the time.

> Third, a sharing system enables sharing with, and between, strangers. A sharing system aims to constantly evolve by integrating newcomers into a practice of sustained sharing behaviors and relations, and then to grow by expanding and evolving this practice in new social terrains.

> Existing literature offers clues to further characterize the potential of this practice ofsharingwith strangers. For example, De Angelis (2017: 241) refers to this potential as a form of “boundary commoning”—where one practice of sharing joins with other practices resulting in a new and enlarged system of interdependencies. On the other hand, Katrini (2018: 431) describes this potential as the process where one taxonomical category of sharing expands and bleeds into other categories. However, for us, the practice of sharing with strangers represents what Carse (1986) calls, “inﬁnite games”: practices that are intentionally organized such that once initiated, they can facilitate, enable, and perpetuate their own persistence. To formulate this more concretely, sharing often leads to even more sharing, and through the design of the system, individuals are able to continue to share, and to extend the beneﬁts of sharing to others.

> First, Ostrom (2006: 88) emphasizes that uncertain and complex environment prompts the constitution of the CPR. Where there is environ- mental uncertainty in resource availability and where dealing with this uncertainty demands complex socio-technical cooperation, individuals tend to share the CPR.

> Third, Ostrom (2006: 89) notes “the sheer perseverance manifested in these resource sys- tems and institutions”. In spite of an uncertain and complex operation environment, and in spite of all the opportunistic ways in which individuals could defect from cooperation, these commons have endured across time. Given these similarities, the primary objective is then to explain the sustainability and robustness of successful CPR systems (Ostrom 2006: 89).

> Ostrom (2006: 90) outlines eight design principles that might explain this “sheer perse- verance” of successful commons. They are namely, (i) Clearly deﬁned boundaries; (ii) Congruence between appropriation and provision rules and local conditions; (iii) Collective-choice arrangements; (iv) Monitoring; (v) Graduated sanctions; (vi) Conﬂict-resolution mechanisms; (vii) Minimal recognition of rights to organize, and for CPRs that belong to larger systems; and (viii) Nested enterprises.

> we suggest that Ostrom’s approach is primarily scientiﬁc and not, as the phrase ‘design principles’ appears to suggest, prescriptive or design-oriented. At best, Ostrom’s principles here suggest that design activities could have occurred, but they fall short of demonstrating just how the design process might have been applied to attain a successful CPR system.

> And diametrically different from Ostrom’s (2006) work, we do not, and cannot, take the success ofa sharing system as a given empirical fact, and then deduce the principles that must be present in order for the successful sharing system to be true. In other words, unlike Ostrom’s approach, we are unable to deduce functional principles as hypothesized design principles from sharing systems that exist and are, moreover, successful

> But what makes our design method modeled after the systems approach relevant for sharing by design? Why, exactly, should the sys- tems approach be privileged over other major design approaches—for example, the rational-computational design approach (Simon 1996), the increasingly popular par- ticipatory or co-design approach (Manzini 2015), and the dialogic-reﬂective design approach (Schön 1990)—to name just three major approaches in design? After all, to deﬁne something as a system is a design choice (Churchman 1971: 42), and this choice has to be justiﬁed.

### id852453841

> when compared to these three major approaches, the systems approach offers the best ﬁt for the design challenges peculiar to sharing systems. This best ﬁt can be justiﬁed in the following two ways. First, and relative to other design approaches, the systems approach permits a clear visualization of important components within a sharing system. The systems approach then aims to represent these components and their dynamic relationships abstractly, but nevertheless clearly, to the designers and other participants. The transparency of the systems-driven design process then can facilitate more robust discussions among the participants. Second, these system components are represented as discrete categories; they are neither ordered nor weighed in any pre-conceived way. This can permit the skillful system designer to design various alternative sharing systems by using the same building blocks: varying their relations, ordering or weightage, and correspondingly, also their interactions and feedback. In turn, this process then produces different outputs and system performances. The ability to create alternative systems is deemed as one of the primary strengths of the systems approach (see Churchman 1971: 46). Because the context of sharing systems can vary, this ability to vary the design of sharing systems systematically according to different contexts is therefore a key advantage of this design approach.

> the rational-computational approach ﬁrst aims to deﬁne and structure the design problem, and then to search for the optimal solution within the paramet- rically bounded solution space of the deﬁned problem. The rational-computational approach is rooted in the science of Operations Research (Churchman 1979: 16; Simon 1996: 27). But beginning with Churchman’s (1968) later work on the sys- tems approach—especially with his unﬁnished meditation on how to properly secure

### id852454055

> systemic improvements (see Ulrich 1994)—Churchman started to depart from the paradigm of Operations Research. Gradually, Churchman realized that the measure of optimality alone is insufﬁcient for the weightier question of system sustainability. In other words, while the rational-computational approach excels in seeking out the optimal design solution by increasingly reﬁning its bounding parameters, it could be largely agnostic to the sacriﬁces that might have to be made to attain this optimality (Churchman 1968: 4)—sacriﬁces that could unsettle the entire system. Furthermore, for the optimal solution to remain in this state, it has to presume different social relations that have not been taken into account in this design approach. The warrant of these social relations has been corroborated by Ostrom’s (2006: 94) design prin- ciple of monitoring, where in order for the CPR to remain in an optimal state, the community has to actively audit its conditions and monitor the behaviors of resource appropriators. For these reasons, the rational-computational design approach remains inadequate for the design of a socially complex sharing system.

> Second, participatory and co-design approaches are also relatively limited for the design of sharing systems. Invariably, sharing systems are participatory in nature, and may even practice some degree of self-design, where participants try to shape their sharing systems together. Although the participatory approach for generating design knowledge is deeply meaningful, it is, however, also highly contingent and uncertain. An instance of a successful participatory design in one context may not be replicated in other contexts. While the participatory approach can be systematic, it cannot be fully rationalized. Designers employing the participatory approach may never come to formulate the necessary constituents or principles underlying any instance of successful participatory design.

> co-design begins with a powerful default starting point, which is the parity of politics in design. In co-design, everyone is an equal designer to everyone else. Admittedly, this is the primary strength of the co-design approach. But what is often left unsaid is its chief weakness: if everyone has an equal right to make design decisions, then exactly how should a decision be made? And per- haps more importantly, by what means? To these important questions, the co-design approach does not offer any immediate answers. However, Marx (1978: 364) offers a clue: “between equal rights force decide”. Even if one does not concede to Marx’s pessimistic projection, one may have to concede that although co-design begins on a promising note, it is nevertheless an underconstrained design approach that bears the risk of an uncertain ending—one that may eventually be mired in conﬂict and strife.

> For Schön, nearly every design parameter—even the design problem—canbe unsettled or overturned by learning in the design process. In Schön’s (1990: 136–137) approach, designers ‘converse’ with the materials of the design situation and they learn from this conversation. Through this learning, the structure of the design problem also evolves. Importantly, this suggests the unsettling possibility that the designersmight even learn that design is futile and subsequently, to relinquish design completely. In other words, while Schön’s design approach is powerful, it cannot assume the persistence of design and at the same time, it has to concede to the remote but possible cessation of design activities. But conceived more positively, designers relying on Schön’s approach are able to transform the deﬁnition of the design problem in ways that cannot be predicted in advance, which paradoxically renders this approach underdetermined yet powerful. In this way, Schön’s approach is thoroughly rigged with uncertainties but it is in the same vein, also laden with latent potentialities. The systems approach cannot hope to match the full power of Schön’s approach. Yet by the same token, the systems approach also does not need to concede to the radical limitations found in Schön’s approach. In Schön’s design approach: when the dialogue between designers and the design situation ceases, the design process also terminates. This is a fatal possibility that sharing by design cannot afford. For the sharing system to persist, new dialogues must be constantly invigorated in place of old ones that have ceased. To avoid this possibility, Schön’s dialogic-reﬂective approach may be instructive, but not decisive, for sharing by design.

> Based on our study of Churchman’s (1971) systems theory, we propose at least eight general components present in any sufﬁciently complex sharing system. They are namely, (i) The environment; (ii) Goals; (iii) Guarantors; (iv) Performance mea- sures; (v) Stakeholders; (vi) Resources; (vii) The social forces: major ones include culture, politics and ethics; (viii) Enemies (of the system).

> Second, the seventh component of ‘the social forces’ is a metaphorical bundle of several social categories. This component serves as an artiﬁcial cap on the innumer- able social forces that can modulate the sharing system. We have relied on culture, politics and ethics to represent this artiﬁcial cap while admitting that there are many other social categories that are missed by these general headings.

Katrini (2019) suggests that a sharing system can leverage on the potentials ofa city by making itself more publicly visible near important thoroughfares, or by choosing to situate itself close to other existing amenities that can reinforce sharing. Conversely, a sharing system could begin to undermine itselfwhen it neglects its environment,

> There has been a long line of thinking on a system enacting its environment in organizational science (Scott 1992: 141), which entails gaining control on the environment in order to reduce the system’s own uncertainty. A vivid example of this took shape in the R-Urban project in Colombes, north-west of Paris. This was an attempt in creating an ecology of local practices (Petrescu et al. 2016: 722), where sharing activities expanded beyond any one speciﬁc urban site to create an enlarged and interdepen- dent ecology of sharing practices, which then became their own immediate environ- ment. In a similar vein, researchers and designers have started to conjecture on how co-working as a sharing practice can begin to transform surrounding urban areas (Armondi and Di Vita 2017; Katrini 2019).

> The goal is the raison d’être of the system: it is the objective that a system works to attain. On this, goals can be further distinguished into intermediate goals and the ﬁnal goal. While the former has to be attained in order to reach the ﬁnal goal, the latter is the summative purpose of the system. In this way, successive or persistent attainment of different intermediate goals improves the odds of attaining the ﬁnal goal. And also for this reason, it is important that intermediate goals do not conﬂict, but rather, reinforce the ﬁnal goal.

### id852458700

> The ﬁnal goal sets the overall direction of the system. In this way, the ﬁnal goal overrides, but also regulates, the intermediate goals (see Meadows 2008: 162). This means that it is possible to assess the appropriateness of intermediate goals using the ﬁnal goal as a benchmark: intermediate goals that are consistent to the ﬁnal goal are admitted, while those that conﬂict with the ﬁnal goal are rejected. The ﬁnal goal then guides and shapes the system.

> For instance, if the ﬁnal goal of a sharing system is deﬁned as more efﬁcient sharing, and efﬁciency is measured by increasing the number of participants while conserving the shared resources, then the system will operate to produce as many participants as possible. Because the goal is nowmeasured by the number of participants, this system may or may not produce the behaviors and relations that are integral to an enduring sharing system.

> We suggest that both the proper selection of a measuring metric as well as the appropriate deﬁnition of a ﬁnal goal are important considerations. But we emphasize that the appropriate deﬁnition of a ﬁnal goal ought to be prioritized. This is because the choice or the deﬁnition of the ﬁnal goal has to precede its own metric. Furthermore, the question on the choice of an appropriate metric is only meaningful if this ﬁnal goal is also an ethical one.

The former are objectively true or applicable measures for all sharing systems, while the latter involve measures that may vary according to different stakeholders, or clients—individuals or social groups that the sharing system serve.

### id852466424

> One objective measure is a performance measure that has been derived from the goal of the sharing system. As discussed, if the goal is simply stated as more efﬁcient sharing, then one objective measure entails evaluating the performance of the system based on the number of clients it is able to serve. An increasing number of clients, at least up to a certain threshold, would mean that the sharing system is performing well. Conversely, a decreasing number of clients is likely to imply that the sharing system is underperforming. And if the goal of the sharing system is stated as self- perpetuation, then an objective measure at least entails ﬁnding out if outgoing clients have been balanced by incoming clients.
> Even so, meeting any one objective performance measure does not guarantee the success of the sharing system. This is because ‘success’ is a subjective performance measure.

> Clearly, how success is deﬁned will at least depend on the environmental conditions of the sharing system, and also on the preferences and expectations of the clients. In a largely favorable environment, a highly motivated client body is not likely to be only satisﬁed by the sharing system meeting its stipulated goals, it has to exceed them. Conversely, in a highly constrained and uncertain environment, even a somewhat enthusiastic client body has to temper its expectation. For these reasons, the goal of the sharing system cannot completely determine the performance measures of this system. Careful considerations of the clients’ expectations in relation to the environmental conditions are also important.

> As aforementioned, the clients are the stakeholders of the sharing system. These clients include the immediate individuals or social groups that participate in the sharing system, and also a group of unknown users that rely on this sharing system occasionally, but are yet formal members of this system. Other important stakehold- ers include the designers of the sharing system, who conceptualize and deﬁne the speciﬁc inter-relationships within this system, and also municipal authorities that have immense discretion in supporting or even repelling this sharing system (see Petrescu et al. 2016). A far-seeing designer of the sharing system will also consider the real-estate developer, who sees the potential in the rising valuation of the adjacent urban sites by sharing activities, as a potential stakeholder in the system.

> To better predict and to regulate their behaviors, an intricate set of rules pertaining to monitoring, sanctions and conﬂict-resolution has to be devised in a CPR system. Even so, a sharing system will still face the challenge of behavioral regulation. However, urban sharing systems are complicated by the reality that they have to admit a far wider range of clients than Ostrom’s CPR system—clients who may not readily concede to mutual monitoring, or who can easily evade sanctions by exiting the sharing system (Hirschman 1970). In the absence of social solidarity, the prudent designer of the sharing system will have to ﬁnd ways to build and reinforce bridging social capital between plural clients in the system.

> Sharing this type of resources tends to imply division: where ifmore of these objects are shared, then there are fewer left to share. Their subtractable and rivalrous qual- ity also means that if one individual is using a resource, then it cannot be shared with another individual, and so sharing here adheres to a form of zero-sum sharing (John 2017). Because of this rivalrous nature, these resources can also be perceived as scarce goods.

> , distributive rules become critical for this sharing sys- tem: is sharing operated on the priority of ‘ﬁrst come ﬁrst serve’, or the rule of ‘sharing out to the greatest need’? The practice of sharing tangible and subtractable resources therefore renders the notion of fairness visible, salient, and perhaps, even contentious.

> Second, there are resources that are intangible, non-subtractable, non-excludable, and indivisible. These resources are not depleted byan increase in either the frequency or the magnitude of sharing. For example, sharing news, information, or knowledge are clear instances of such resources. Kornberger and Borch (2015) rightly claim that using these resources through more frequent sharing does not deplete but rather increases their value.

> Third, there are resources that straddle between tangible and intangible resources. On one level, these third type of resources are subtractable and rivalrous; yet in shar- ing them, new non-subtractable and indivisible resources as new experiences and knowledge are also produced and shared. On another level, sharing these resources can create new relations, rapport and bonding social capital, which lead to the for- mation of a creative agency that may transform the very sharing system itself.

> The social forces can be conceptualized as a mysterious black box in the sharing system: the designer of the sharing system knows that these forces exist but they can neither be systematically enumerated nor their operations accurately known.

> important to note that the use of ‘forces’ is metaphorical; they do not imply New- tonian physical forces. These ‘forces’ are actually closer to what Durkheim (1982) refers to as ‘social facts’: ideas, beliefs, and categories that are external to an indi- vidual, but can constrain this individual’s actions.

> One example of a relevant social fact in the sharing system is the sharing culture (Katrini 2018; Light and Miskelly 2015). In a sharing system that maintains a culture of demanding participants to hold each other accountable on what they share, and also how they share, this system will operate in a starkly different manner from one that merely conceives sharing as a form of transaction

> another example of a relevant social fact is the politics of the sharing system. A sharing system where participants not only share resources, but also share an equal power to decide how to run this system (Stavrides 2016), will function differently from a system where management is centralized.

> ‘The enemy’ is Churchman’s exclusive analytic invention in systems theory. Church- man (1979: 13) deﬁnes ‘the enemy’ as a consortium of opposites: an enemy is both distrusted and admired; an enemy is both respected and feared. The enemy is, there- fore, a legitimate adversary that threatens the system. This enemy may or may not be real; its facticity is quite beside the point. The primary purpose of the enemy is to function as a dialectical category: the enemy represents an opposition to the purpose or the philosophy of a sharing system. It is furthermore an embodiment of different interest positions that could be advanced had this sharing system not existed. The enemy, in other words, has every incentive to eliminate a sharing system. To con- ceive this enemy ahead of time, and to anticipate its many possible oppositions, is no different from designing the defenses of the sharing system.

The designers can design for speciﬁc defenses by anticipating the enemy’s every possible move, or the designers can design for an overall systemic resilience, which can cushion the sharing system against the assaults ofthe enemy.
