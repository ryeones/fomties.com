- Summary: Using Daily Notes in a note-taking app like Apple Notes helps manage overwhelming information by allowing you to gather thoughts and ideas throughout the day in one place. Instead of sorting information immediately, you can defer sorting until later, making the process more efficient and less stressful. This method streamlines your daily routine, making it easier to handle various types of content and providing a clear historical reference for future use.
