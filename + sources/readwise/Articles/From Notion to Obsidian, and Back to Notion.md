- Summary: The author discusses their experience switching between Notion and Obsidian, two note-taking and organization tools. They highlight the benefits of Obsidian, such as its support for citations and LaTeX math, making it useful for academic writing. However, they ultimately switched back to Notion because of its ability to easily attach complex media and sync between different devices. The author also compares Notion to Evernote, noting that Notion's use of blocks with unique IDs makes it powerful. They mention some drawbacks of Notion, such as the need to export references in markdown style, but overall, they find Notion to be a more flexible and reliable choice for their needs.
