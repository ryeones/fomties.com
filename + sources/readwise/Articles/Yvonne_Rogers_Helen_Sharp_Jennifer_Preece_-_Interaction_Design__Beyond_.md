> Designing Alternatives This is the core activity of designing and is part of the Develop phase of the double diamond: proposing ideas for meeting the requirements. For interaction design, this activity can be viewed as two subactivities: conceptual design and concrete design. Conceptual design involves producing the conceptual model for the product, and a conceptual model describes an abstraction outlining what people can do with a product and what concepts are needed to understand how to interact with it. Concrete design considers the detail of the product including the colors, sounds, terminology, and images to use; menu design; and icon design. Alternatives are considered at every point.

The most effective way for people to evaluate such designs is to interact with them, and this can be achieved through prototyping. This does not necessarily mean that a piece of software is required. There are different prototyping techniques, not all of which require a working piece of software. For example, paper-based prototypes are quick and cheap to build and are effective for identifying problems in the early stages of design, and through role-playing, people can get a real sense of what it will be like to interact with the product.

> Many projects start by discovering requirements from which alternative designs are generated. Prototype versions of the designs are developed and then evaluated. During prototyping or based on feedback from evaluations, the team may need to refine the requirements or to redesign. One or more alternative designs may follow this iterative cycle in parallel. Implicit in this cycle is that the final product will emerge in an evolutionary fashion from an initial idea through to the finished product or from limited functionality to sophisticated functionality. Exactly how this evolution happens varies from project to project. However many times the product goes through the cycle, development ends with an evaluation activity that ensures that the final product meets the prescribed user experience and usability criteria. This evolutionary production relates to the right side of the double diamond, but note that in this interaction design process, discovering requirements may also be revisited.

> right team, and organize the time and space to run the sprint. Phase 1 (Understand): Experts from across the business articulate the problem space. Phase 2 (Define): Evaluate what was learned in Phase 1 and identify a focus for the sprint. Phase 3 (Sketch): Generate many ideas and alternative solutions; then work as a team to
> identify a single well-developed solution per team member. Phase 4 (Decide): Choose the single idea to be progressed through the design sprint. Phase 5 (Prototype): Develop a prototype for the chosen solution that is just real enough
> to validate and covers only the aspects you want to test. We discuss prototyping further in Chapter 12. Phase 6 (Validate): Gather feedback on the prototype from users and other stakeholders. At the end of this phase your chosen solution will be validated, or not!

> Research in the wild (RITW) develops technology solutions in everyday living by creating and evaluating new technologies and experiences in situ. The approach supports designing prototypes in which researchers often experiment with new technological possibilities that can change and even disrupt behavior, rather than ones that fit in with existing practices. The results of RITW studies can be used to challenge assumptions about technology and human behavior in the real world and to inform the re-thinking of HCI theories. The perspective taken by RITW studies is to observe how people react to technology and how they change and integrate it into their everyday lives.

Where possible, criteria that are measurable and specific are preferable. • Effectiveness: Identifying measurable criteria for this goal is particularly difficult since it is a combination of the other goals. For example, does the system support travel organization, choosing transport routes, booking accommodation, and so on? In other words, is the product used?
> • Efficiency: Is it clear how to ask for recommendations from the product? How quickly does it identify a suitable route or destination details?
> • Safety: How often does data get lost or is the wrong option chosen? This may be measured, for example, as the number of times this happens per trip.
> • Utility: How many functions offered are used for every trip, how many every other trip, and how many are not used at all? How many tasks are difficult to complete in a reasonable time because functionality is missing or the right subtasks aren’t supported?
> • Learnability: How long does it take for a novice user to be able to do a series of set tasks, for example, to book a hotel room in Paris near the meeting venue for the meeting dates, identify appropriate flights from Sydney to Wellington, or find out whether a visa is needed to go to China?
> • Memorability: If the product isn’t used for a month, how many functions can the user remember how to perform? How long does it take to remember how to perform the most frequent task?
> • Satisfaction: How satisfied are users after booking a trip? How satisfied are they after going on a trip with the handheld version? This could be measured using one of the customer satisfaction scales mentioned in Chapter 1.

It also does these actions in quite different ways from how a mechanical engine works or how a human being might search a library for books on a given topic. The similarities implied by the use of the term search engine, therefore, are at a general level.

Logically and culturally (meaning, in the physical world), it should be placed under the desk. But users would not have been able to see it because it would have been hidden by the desktop surface. So, it needed to go on the desktop. While some people found this irksome, most did not find it to be a problem.

They have strong associations, provid- ing an intuitive way of organizing limited content that is “card sized.” They can easily be flicked through, sorted, and themed. They structure content into meaningful chunks, similar to how paragraphs are used to chunk a set of related sentences into distinct sections (Babich, 2016).

> One of the most influential visions in computing was Mark Weiser’s (1991) who proposed that computers would become part of the environment, embedded in a variety of everyday objects, devices, and displays. He envisioned a world of serenity, comfort, and awareness, where people were kept perpetually informed of what was happening around them, what was going to happen, and what had just happened. Ubiquitous computing devices would enter a person’s center of attention when needed and move to the periphery of their attention when not, enabling the person to switch calmly and effortlessly between activities without having to figure out how to use a computer when performing their tasks. In essence, the technology would be unobtrusive and largely disappear into the background. People would be able to get on with their everyday and working lives, interacting with information and communicating and collaborating with others without being distracted or becoming frus- trated with technology.

For example, facial and touch IDcan be configured on newer smartphones and laptops to enable password-free mobile banking. Once these are set up, a user simply needs to put their face in front of their phone’s camera or their finger on the fingerprint sensor. These alternative approaches put the onus on the phone to recognize and authenticate the person rather than the person having to learn and remember a password.

A key difference from other forms of MFA is that the login information is stored directly on someone’s device and is uploaded only to the website when matched with their biometric authentication such as a selfie or fingerprint.

This includes creating techniques to evaluate frustration, stress, and moods by analyzing people’s expressions and conversations and designing novel wearable sensors for people to communicate their emotional states. More recently, affective computing has included exploring how affect influences personal health (Jacques et al., 2017).

> The frequency of feedback is considered important; continuous or daily feedback on energy consumption has been found to yield higher savings results than monthly feedback. The type of graphical representation also has an effect. If the image used is too obvious and explicit (for instance, a finger pointing at the user), it may be perceived as too personal, blunt, or “in your face,” resulting in people objecting to it. In contrast, simple images (for example, an infographic or emoticon) that are more anonymous but striking and whose function is to get people’s attention may be more effective. They may encourage people to reflect more on their energy use and even promote public debate about what is represented and how it affects them. However, if the image used is too abstract and implicit, other meanings may be attributed to it, such as simply being an art piece (such as an abstract painting with colored stripes that change in response to the amount of energy used), resulting in people ignoring it. The ideal may be somewhere in between. Peer pressure can also be effective, where peers, parents, or children chide or encourage one another to turn lights off, take a shower instead of a bath, and so on.

In particu- lar, cascading menus require them to move their cursor over the menu item, while holding the mouse or touchpad down, and then to move their cursor over to the next menu list when the cascading menu appears and select the next desired option.

Besides looking at and navigating through a 360-degree visual landscape, auditory and haptic feed- back can be added to make the experience feel even more immersive. The resulting user experience can be highly engaging; it can feel as if one really is flying around a virtual world.

> Another distinguishing feature of VR is the different viewpoints it can offer. Players can have a first-person perspective, where their view of the game or environment is through their own eyes, or a third-person perspective, where they see the world through an avatar visually represented on the screen.

> Many people browse the web from their smartphone or tablet. The touchscreen on these kinds of devices affords very different interactions compared with interacting with desktop or laptop displays using a keyboard or mouse. The fonts, buttons, and menu tabs that are standard on the latter are too small and awkward to select when using a finger on a touch- screen. Instead of double-clicking interface elements, as people do with a mouse or trackpad, tablet and smartphone screens involve tapping, swiping, and pinching methods.

A commonly used approach is responsive website design—where the browser automatically resizes the layout and changes the graphic design, fonts, and appear- ance depending on the screen size (smartphone, tablet, or PC) on which it is being displayed.

> Alan Cooper et al. (2014) in their classic book suggest that appliance interfaces require the designer to view them as transient interfaces, where the interaction is short. All too often, however, designers provide full-screen control panels or an unnecessary array of physical but- tons that serve to frustrate and confuse the user where only a few, presented in a structured way, would be much better. Here the two fundamental design principles of simplicity and visibility are paramount.

> Similarly, speech technol- ogy has been designed with a feature called barge-in that allows callers to interrupt a system message and provide their request or response before the message has finished playing. This can be useful if the system has numerous options from which the caller may choose and the chooser knows already what they want.

Some researchers focus on how to make it appear natural (that is, like human conversation), while others are concerned more with how to help people navigate efﬁciently through a menu system by enabling them to recover easily from errors (their own or the system’s), to be able to escape and go back to the main menu (similar to the undo button of a GUI), and to guide those who are vague or ambiguous in their requests for information or services using prompts.
