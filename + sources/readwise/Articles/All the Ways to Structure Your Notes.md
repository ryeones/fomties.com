- Summary: Organizing and structuring notes in a personal knowledge management (PKM) system is essential for efficient information retrieval. This article explores various methods, including folders, tags, backlinks, and note properties, for organizing notes in applications like Obsidian. Folders provide a simple and focused way to categorize notes, but may limit flexibility and exploration. Tags offer fast filtering and the ability to assign multiple categories to a note, but can become inconsistent or subjective if not managed properly. Backlinks create connections between related notes and allow for easy navigation, while note properties offer the potential to create a database-like structure but require more effort to maintain. Ultimately, the best approach depends on individual preferences and needs.
