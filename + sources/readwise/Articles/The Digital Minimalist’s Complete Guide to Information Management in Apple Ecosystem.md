> From the ITIL’s best practices, I know it is best to streamline and operationalize your daily routines through a single point of entry.

> *1 — Inbox* in the **Apple Mail** application. It’s all clear here, you just cannot avoid having incoming mail on a daily basis, there will always be *something* from *someone* in your mailbox to process. The only way I ease my pain here is by creating smart folders for *“Unread”* messages and messages arrived *“Today”.*

> 2 — *Inbox* in the **Apple Files** application. This is just my replacement for well-known productivity citadels — *Downloads* folder and *Desktop* folder (that was a joke, obviously). I have renamed **Downloads** to **Inbox** and moved it to the **iCloud Drive**. I’ve also pointed all the applications that may potentially use regular Downloads folder to the new location (*Safari*, *Slack*, etc). This way I have unified file "inbox" across all my devices, that follows very similar processing principles.

> 3 — *Daily Notes* in **Apple Notes** application. This is the place for almost all the content that I generate throughout the day — notes, drafts, thoughts, meeting minutes, screenshots, summaries, handwritten notes, and so on.

> My main intention is to spend the least amount of time possible deciding what to store and where. I can do this if I **postpone** decision-making to a later, more convenient time.

### id784618057

> **Wrong way:** create a folder structure and try to create notes right in the corresponding folders during the day. For example, you have one folder for travel stuff, one for interesting articles, and another for legal documents. During the day when you come across travel-related info you put it directly into the *Travel* folder, legal docs are going to the *Legal* folder directly, etc. **This is wrong**!

> The whole purpose of this story is to spend less time searching for information, be super effective in manipulating the information, and ease the storage burden off your brain **while getting your life goals accomplished**.

> Because goals have a magical ability to structure things on their own. Without the goal set any movement will be in the wrong direction. On the contrary, if you have one, it will very well filter out everything irrelevant and distill only the content that matters.

> **an isolated file that is left somewhere in the file system, is often of a less value when it is out of context.** Notes,** or anything more sophisticated than just a file manager, do exactly this — they help you wrap particular file with some context around, give it more meaning and value.** The longer you work with Digital Information, the more evident it is — a single file stored somewhere inside your file system is rarely a self-sufficient creature.

### id784619047

> **Files** are good as an Inbox for Downloads or any other isolated files that do not require a context. **Files** are also good for any Work-in-Progress documents or projects, that are still being baked and / or require collaboration with other people.

> **Notes** are good for static files that require some context around it, and will not require any further modification (outcomes of your work, projects, reference documents, resources for your projects, etc)

> • Do I need this particular information at all? If I’m 100% sure I don’t, I delete it.
> • Is this information **actionable**? If yes, this goes to my ToDo app (**Apple Reminders** in my case)
> • If it is **not actionable** (i.e. reference information), where will I need this information in the future? Which goal will it help me to achieve if I store it? Decide where exactly you will store this content for further references so that the easiness of navigation and “searchability” of this content is at its maximum.
