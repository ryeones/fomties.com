- Summary: RGB (red, green, blue) is used for digital displays like monitors and creates colors by adding light. CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) is used for printing and creates colors by subtracting from a white background. When designing for print, always set up your artwork in CMYK to ensure accurate color representation.
