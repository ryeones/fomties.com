- Summary: The author of the article recommends switching from the note-taking app Bear to Obsidian for several reasons. They highlight the lack of certain features in Bear, such as backlinks and a graph view, which Obsidian already offers. They also note that Obsidian has had significant updates in 2022, including pop-up windows, browser-like tabs, and the addition of Canvas for visualizing ideas. The author emphasizes that Obsidian has a robust community of plugins and a multi-platform availability, unlike Bear. They provide reasons why someone might choose to use Bear, such as its simplicity and polished design, but ultimately argue that Obsidian offers more flexibility and functionality.
