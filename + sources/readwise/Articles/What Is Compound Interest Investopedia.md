- Summary: Compound interest is the interest earned on both the original investment and the interest that has already accumulated. For example, if you invest $10,000 at a 5% interest rate, you earn more with compound interest over three years compared to simple interest. The difference grows larger over time, making compound interest very powerful for long-term savings.
