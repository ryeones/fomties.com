> file is sitting on your desktop right here you could
> create a new email and attach it but there's an easier way to do that just drag it onto the mail icon in the dock and boom it immediately gets attached and you can fill in the the subject line and the recipient and stuff like that and send it off really handy right all right if you have a paper document let's say it's sitting on your desk and you want to send an email and send that paper document you could first scan it and upload it to your drive etc etc there's a faster way to do this so let's send an email to myself again and I'll say here's that file what I can do is I can click this button right here
> and if I have my iPhone nearby I can actually click scan document now my iPhone turns into a scanner and I can point that at a document and scan the document click save or tap save and the document will be inserted in the email
