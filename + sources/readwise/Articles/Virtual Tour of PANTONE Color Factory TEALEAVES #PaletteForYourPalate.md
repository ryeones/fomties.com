> the reason for for color measurement instruments is that our eyes are very our perception of color is very subjective and what I see is very difficult to communicate to you so we use instrumentation because it kind of serves as a as a color referee okay it gives us an actual number a quantifiable color difference from a Target that we
> want to achieve and maintain versus what we've produced okay that's called a delta or change in E
