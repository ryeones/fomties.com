> "Does lack of sleep affect memory?" Yes, definitely. If you don't get enough sleep, you're not gonna be able to pay attention or have tremendous focus the next day. And focus is a huge cornerstone of having a good memory. On the other side of things, sleep is super important for consolidating memories.
> During certain deeper states of sleep, your hippocampus is actually transferring data from short term to the long term. And if that process doesn't happen, you will potentially lose that information. So it's a way to consolidate that day's information for the long term.

> "Does memory loss or weakening always mean dementia or Alzheimer's?" Definitely not. Although I will say, if you are worried, I would consult a doctor. Just because you're getting older doesn't mean that your memory has to get worse.

> "How the actual [beep] does memory work?"
> So it used to be thought that memories were stored entirely in the hippocampus which is a part of the brain parallel to your ear, about the size of your thumb. Recently, they discovered that, actually, different kinds of memories are stored in different parts of the brain.

> "What the [beep] is it about moving that totally wipes my memory? I get up to do something, and I instantly forget what that thing was." So there's an interesting study that was done by a psychologist at Notre Dame where he talked about this phenomenon that we forget things when we move through doorways,
> when you open the fridge and you forget what you opened it for, or you walk into a room and you forget what you were walking in there for. We forget things where we cross an event boundary. And so there wasn't really any solution to it other than maybe when you're trying to memorize something, stay where you are rather than crossing some kind of barrier mid learning or mid memory.

> "How [beep] I can memorize Taylor Swift lyrics but not physics formulas?" There are a few things at play here, one is procedural memory.
> That's basically muscle memory. When you sing a song or listen to a song over and over again, you are building it into your long-term muscle memory. Second at play here is the emotional response. You're connecting to her music, her lyrics, the way it makes you feel, and that's a lot more interesting than say, a physics formula. And then the third thing at play is encoding. The way that the song is structured, the beat, the rhythm, the way things rhyme lends itself to being easier to memorize.

> "Got any hacks for how to remember a list of 11 items?"
> Let's say you wanna remember a list of grocery items. All right, let's say that we have asparagus, bread, bananas, sour cream, and coffee beans. **To memorize that list, we can use a technique called the linking method which basically takes each of the items on our list, turns them into some kind of fun interactive image, and connects it one by one to the next one on the list.**

> "How do you memorize lines overnight?
> Asking for a friend." Yeah. So there's this technique I call the first letter method. And basically, you take a passage that you're trying to memorize and you read it a few times, then write it down, this is important, just the first letters of each word as they show themselves in the actual text. Then, you'll be surprised that you can actually read from that first letter only script and remember the full words for the whole thing. You do that a few times, then take it away, close your eyes and see if you can remember it. And most times, like nine times outta 10,
> you'll have the whole passage memorized.

> "Is there a correlation between exercise and memory?" Yes, both indirectly and directly. Indirectly, being fit and working out and exercising makes you feel good. It lowers anxiety, reduces stress, improves sleep. All of those things improve your memory. And then directly, it improves blood flow to the brain, it reduces inflammation in the brain, and it encourages brain health.

> "What is a memory palace,
> and how do you make one? Inquiring minds want to know." All right, so a memory palace, it's a technique where you use a physical space that you map out in your mind, and you place images for the things you're memorizing along that pathway. Some of the best memory palaces are gonna be places that you're super familiar with. And then when you wanna recall the information, all you gotta do is go back to that same physical space in your mind and walk through the place.

> "How to memorize a deck of cards?" At the Memory Championships, one of the events is to memorize a full 52-card deck
> in sequence as fast as possible. Now, the way I do that, I do a combination of changing the cards into images and then storing them in a memory palace. How do I come up with the images? There's a system called the PAO system, person, action, object. Every card, I've given a preset person, action, and object to. So whenever I see it, I don't see the card, I see the person or the action associated with that or the object. And for every three cards,
> I group them into this mini scene. The first card's always the person, the second card's always the action or the verb, and the third is the object. So to take an example, the first card that we had was Eight of Clubs which to me, is Bear Grylls, the action adventurer guy.

> "How are bad memories so, so clear and exact in our minds but happy memories fade away?" Back in the Medieval ages, they would throw kids in the river after memorizing something,
> and it was so that they could actually remember the information better because their adrenaline spiked right after learning. And there are studies that show that in situations of high stress or where your adrenaline is peaked, you're actually gonna remember that information better.

> "How does memory have fragrance? Like, why can I summon the smell of fall 2019 into my brain? Explain how I can smell my kindergarten classroom, but I don't know what I did yesterday." So smell is one of the earliest evolved senses in our brain, and it actually bypasses this thing called the thalamus
> which is responsible for kinda delegating information between different parts of the brain. So technically with smell memories, they go directly to either the amygdala or the hippocampus which are responsible for dealing with memories. That's why usually smell memories are so intense and so instant.

### id792665812

> "How are mnemonics helpful? It's just a second thing to memorize." When you use mnemonics and the proper technique, you're taking advantage of things that our brains are really good at, namely, thinking in pictures. We remember pictures way better than anything else, pictures that have meaning to yourself. And then secondly, spatial orientation or organization.
> How do you structure the images or things that you're memorizing? If you have a way to do that, you're making your life much easier.

> "How do you remember people's names? Really tired of feeling like I'm disrespecting everyone I meet all the time." This is probably one of the most common questions I get. It's only normal that when we're meeting people, we're probably thinking about the smart thing we wanna say or looking cool, but we're not paying attention to the person in front of us who's about to tell us their name.

> "What is your favorite resource for training your memory for tests and quizzes?" There really are three ways to get something
> into your long-term memory, one is spaced repetition. So spacing out over time the things, the study sessions basically, what you're trying to memorize, give it some room. So cramming's not a good idea. The second thing is interweaving. So in between sessions you actually study something totally different and then come back to the information you were trying to remember. That's also very effective. Third would be active recall. So actually trying, actively, to remember the things that you're trying to remember. That sounds pretty obvious,
> but you'd be surprised how many people just look at the thing they're memorizing and think that they'll have it in their memory just by going through it over and over again. When you put that thing away, and you just close your eyes, and you really try to get it, even if it's not perfect, that process is so effective.

> "Anyone know foods that improve your memory?" Yeah, there's a few. Avocado, blueberries, broccoli, turmeric, dark chocolate, and walnuts. I think the main one that I would encourage people to investigate is omega-3, DHA specifically. It's a fatty acid found in the brain.
> We don't get a lot of it in our diet, but we need it to help improve our brain health. So you can get that from fish oil pills. There are certain foods that have it like fatty fish like salmon.

> The best pill you can take to improve your memory is not a pill at all. It's just better diet, better sleep, more exercise, and using your memory.
