- Summary: The Digital World has become an integral part of our lives, with an ever-growing amount of digital information and services. However, keeping track of this information can be overwhelming, as each service has its own rules and interfaces. The physical and digital worlds are now connected and equally important, requiring us to keep our digital lives organized just like our physical lives.

The next article will provide an overview of a Framework for Digital Sanity.
