![August Turak – 13 Things I'd Tell My 20-Year-Old Self (I'm a 72-Year-Old Multimillionaire)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaauiljMyWM&ab_channel=AugustTurak)

* spirituality comes first
    * seek first the kingdom of god
    * making sure that the most important and profound things matter the most (not just about religion
    * being serious about your life and the questions you want answered
    * faith is knowing that by focusing on the right things in life it spills over to other aspects as well
* character is everything
    * character is like a muscle (you can’t just make a decision to do x or don’t do x)
    * it start with the idea of i want to do x etc, but only through practice will you actually make it happen and have character
    * we are what we repeatedly do (aristotle)
    * the ability to get up of bed, be kind to people etc are character traits
    * it is actually hard to find people with good character (find a community, it makes things easier)
    * your environment shapes how you behave
    * warrant buffet attributes to the book how to win friends and influence people
    * you don’t learn to be a leader, you become one (same with other things)
* find a community
    * look for a community that is aligned to what you’re trying to accomplish in life
    * the assumption here is that we are put on this earth to become the best version of ourselves
    * a spiritual transformation from selfishness to selflessness
    * its counterintuitive but the more selfless you are, things tend to work out for you
* find a mentor
    * he’s yelling at you because he cares, when he stops that’s when you should be worried
    * we tend to be very good at finding mentors or teachers in other aspects of life, but when it comes to spiritual or personal development, we tend to want to do it alone
        * if we’re at rock bottom in golf, its where the ball is in the water. that’s when we start looking for mentors or coaches
        * but rock bottom in life is not so stress free and even then, do we even go look for a mentor?
    * don’t worry about having the wrong mentor, focus on being a better student
        * be coachable
* trust the process
    * we want to know the ending of the story before the first steps are taken
    * its a journey into the unknown
    * addicts can’t imagine what being sober is like
        * terrified of living life without a vice
    * even if you can’t understand in the moment (steve jobs you can only connect the dots looking backwards)
    * over time you get more aha moments and you get deeper and deeper but you will still never fully understand something
* take the initiative
    * don’t figure out, find out
    * why not you? don’t take no for an answer
    * there’s very few self starters in the world
* don’t worry about the other guy
    * grass is always greener
    * don’t waste any emotional energy (envy, jealousy etc)
    * turn yourself into someone who is happy for other people’s success
* put yourself in play
    * if you’re trying to get married, but you stew at home about your loneliness
    * put yourself in situations, luck and opportunities come when you actually increase your own probabilities
*  always go to the top
    * take initiative and value people, and say why not, you’ll be surprise at the opportunities that come your way
* have “a guy” 
    * build relationships with people everywhere you go
    * different go to guy for anything you need
    * business is about making and selling things (having a guy for everything, nothing to do with your technical ability)
    * great relationships = knowing people but also knowing how you can help them first before asking
* it’s not what you think, its how you think
    * possible link to paul arden’s book its not how good you are, its how good you want to be?
    * four thinkings
        * magical (fluff)
        * objective (black and white)
        * post modern (subjective)
        * paradoxical (divergent)
            * controlled chaos
            * jumping out the system
            * 2.5 hours or 9 innings
    * your life is a sum total of the decisions you make, prior to decisions are your thinking
        * if you don’t understand your thinking, you will end up with alot of dead ends
*[[ keep your head on it]]
    * never look things up if you cannot remember it (like when something is on the tip of your tongue)
    * training yourself to be determined 
    * how long can you manage frustration 
    * einstein - i’m not any smarter than people, i just stick at problems longer
    * we all want to jump to the final stage where the answer pops into your head
    * clench relax, clench relax, the answer always comes during the relax stage but the clench comes before the relax
        * answers come from surrender, but it doens’t mean you don’t have to fight for it
* get started.. now
