i need to find a streamline way from having an idea to publishing and working on the ideas

my intial plan was to keep using apple notes as a catch all since im familiar, it syncs free, and it just works fast.

at the end of the day when i do a daily review, ill extract ideas from my daily note, or inbox, where ill transfer notable ones into my digital garden vault.

this digital garden vault is only used on my mac, so i dont need obsidian sync or even icloud.

ideally i would still sync through icloud but im not sure if shifting this vault folder from my computer to icloud would damage anything.

plus knowing how much i use icloud, i also dont want to have a scenario where im lazy to backup or transfer clips to my ssd, resulting in some errors.

also, its good to have an environment where i focus on different things. ie apple notes for quick capture, obsidian and my desktop for working and publishing.

i can still do more research on this, but at the moment, this is still the plan.

one thing to note is because i did buy the obsidian quick capture app previously, i donâ€™t really want to waste it. so it would still be good if i could incoperate that somehow.

my current thoughts is either having my digital garden vault placed in icloud (but explained above) or create a separate vault on my phone in icloud, for the sole reason of quick capture.

then again, whatâ€™s the use of apple notese
