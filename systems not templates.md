i was down the rabbit hole of analog journaling recently and i reflected how my adhd nature has often made me dive into these corners of the internet.

i started thinking about it honestly, and how we always switch between the [[next shiny object]] (maybe just me) -  we are always looking for the next tool, app, or magical thing that would transform our lives from 0 to 1.

as what was coined in [[atomic habits]] by [[james clear]], [[you don't rise to your goals, you fall to the level of your systems]], and it made me realise how in this day and age we are so hard up about the perfect way to do a certain thing.

and the fact of the matter is that there is no one way, definitely no perfect template. we like to buy the next template the creator already has, but the thing is it may or may not work for us. we buy a couple more and we see if it fits. 

it is the systems we curate and create for ourselves, by [[steal like an artist|stealing like an artist]].
