title: app idea that i have (meetwhere)
---
was thinking about an app (in the context of singapore first)

to solve my problem of not knowing where to meet or whatâ€™s the best place to hang out at

although singapore is a very small place compared to other countries, it has its own problems in itself

not everyone has access to a car

food preferences

lack of things to do

so what if this application is able to help you find out the best few places that two or more people can consider by activity and distance

for example

input two locations

if the key filter is distance (middle ground) + dinner

it will help you find places within the areas

results will change according to type of activity, and number of people, taking into account public transport vs private transport
