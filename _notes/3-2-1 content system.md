title: 3-2-1 content system

[[3-2-1 back up rule]] is a system that is widely used nowadays.

3 copies. 2 mediums. 1 on the cloud.

this means for every file you own, ideally it should abide by this system.

have 3 copies of the file backed up.

stored in 2 different mediums - namely hard drive and offsite 

and 1 on the cloud - cloud backup isnâ€™t really a backup in traditional sense, but having that additional cloud sync can always come in handy.

similarly, this is a rule i will recommend whthis is the template for a notes layout on my website

the note name has to be the same as the title in the yamlen starting out again in creating content.

as much as there is a lot of value in sticking to one platform, learning the ins and outs, being consistent and getting good at it,

i feel that especially if youâ€™re in for the long game, you are bound to want to be on multiple platforms.

so hereâ€™s the system adapted.

3 platforms. 2 formats. 1 newsletter.

so choose 3 platforms where you are comfortable with. 

x, threads linkedin for text

instagram and tiktok for short form video

youtube for long form video

choose 2 types of formats.

formats in this case refer to both content format (text vs visual) and (short form vs long form)

and 1 newsletter.

newsletter is an essential part of converting your rented audience on social media to owned audience where you nurture them.

depending on your capacity, you can adapt this rule accordingly.

at the very basics, is to stick to one platform, be consistent and get good at it.

if you want to go a step further

i recommend one platform you are more comfortable with (text vs visual) and a newsletter

the ideal starting point would be what i recommended earlier

3 platforms. 2 formats. 1 newsletter.

of course this may not be easy at the beginning, but with the right systems in place

it will be much simpler.
