title: lesson from airbnb's origin story
---
i've heard of the [[airbnb origin story]] before, but it was brought up again recently during my first day at work at [[seek sophie]]

* the simplicity and clarity of airbnbâ€™s founder journey, makes it easy for someone to relate a story especially for a new brand just starting out
	* finding the balance between whatâ€™s concise while also sharing enough nuance to hook viewers in and to stand behind as supporting super fans.
- there's also the idea of [[doing unscalable things in the beginning]]
	- the notion that not everything needs to be automated at the start, in fact there are many stories of start ups (facebook, paypal etc) that does "unscalable things" but only through this practice, allowing the founders to understand problems and pain points on the ground
		- this allows for more specific problem solving
		- and also in the future when automating processes, it would be easier since you have already gone through the hard part of doing something unscalable
