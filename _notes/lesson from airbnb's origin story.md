title: lesson from airbnb's origin story
---
i've heard of the [[airbnb origin story]] before, but it was brought up again recently during my first day at work at [[seek sophie]]

the simplicity and clarity of airbnbâ€™s founder journey, makes it easy for someone to relate a story especially for a new brand just starting out

finding the balance between whatâ€™s concise while also sharing enough nuance to hook viewers in and to stand behind as supporting super fans.
