_things that i have picked up over the years that i really want to remember and follow_

to me, having something like this is a subset of [[creative constraints]]

1. treat others how you want to be treatedÂ 
2. always be kind, you never know what someone else is going through
3. when a thought comes to mind, write it down, but continue finishing up with the current task
4. 3 seconds rule
5. results can disappoint you, but your effort will not. always give your 100% in every circumstance - make do with what you have for the case in point.
