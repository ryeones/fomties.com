this quote is interesting because its the first time i'm using the [[noma framework]] when note-making.

however, it is also interesting because it reminds me of my favourite bible verse [[2 cor 5v7]] . 

it's similar because both allude to the fact that we can't really control our future but only through trusting that it will all work out in the end.

it's slightly different as the deeper meaning behind the verse refers to our faith in him and trusting that everything is according to [[god's plan]].

it important to me because ever since the very first time i heard about this quote from a standford commencement speech by [[steve jobs]], its has stuck with me ever throughout.

aside from that, every few months, especially in periods where i'm feeling lost or fearful of the future, i'll rewatch the entire speech as a form of reminder and clarity.
