title: clusters cause tension, and tension is required for resolution
---
this was from [[Linking Your Thinking with Nick Milo â€“ This Secret Principle Will Transform Your Notes]] talk at the pkm summit, where nick milo was sharing about how mocs can be useful when you start to group notes together in your garden as part of a higher order note.

i suddenly thought of the video about [[August Turak â€“ 13 Things I'd Tell My 20-Year-Old Self (I'm a 72-Year-Old Multimillionaire)]]   where one of the pointers mentioned was how something along the lines of keep on it? 

edit i realised its [[keep your head on it]]

i donâ€™t think the main point was particularly related but there was also this example where he mentioned how when we think of solutions, it is normally during the relaxed phase. however for there to be relaxation, there must be some squeeze or tension prior.

in this sense, perhaps thereâ€™s something related here.
