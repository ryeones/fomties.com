title: buy what is best available now and you can always swap out later
---
first came across this saying when watching a review video about the fx3

most people over complicate buying the perfect camera, but the reality is that cameras, and tech gadgets, or just things in general in this world - there will always be the next big or new thing.

we often fall into [[shiny object syndrome]] and then [[productive procrastination]] yet most of the time the important thing is [[speed over perfection]]. 

in context, the other point he is also saying is that there will always be a new product, so instead of focusing on the camera body (which is swappable) or tend to be switched out faster, invest in a quality lens that can be carried over to another body cam.

i'm not sure what i'm to right now, but i think i have an idea regarding the above paragraph ~ maybe focusing on the right thing is more improtant as we tend to overcomplicate on the things that doesn't really [[move the needle]]
