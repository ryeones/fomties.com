title: note templates for templater
---

as mentioned by [[nick milo]] [[linking your thinking]] video series and his [original forum post](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/the-ultimate-folder-system-a-quixotic-journey-to-ace/63483), ideas and knowledge are often organised by the acronym [[stir]] , which was originally created by *include speaker name* as the term [[latch]]

in simpler terms, latch refers to:
1. location
2. alphabet
3. time
4. category
5. hierarchy (or continuum)

[[nick milo]] represents them as stir:
1. space
2. time
3. importance
4. relatedness

essentially consolidating the different headspace's that we jump between when managing ideas and knowledge. so in order to increase the chances of [[serendipitous connections]] to be possible, having properties of notes at the very minim cover areas of stir.

although it is easy to fall into the trap of [[productive procrastination]] and spend more time [[working in properties instead of the content]] of a note, here are some rules or [[creative constraints]] i tend to have for my notes.
