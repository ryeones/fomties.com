[[the best basketball shoe is the one you forget that you are wearing]]

i first stumbled on this quote while watching a camera review video on the fx3 and zve1. 

the main point of introducing this quote was to hone in on the point that he felt the fx3 was such a good buy for him because he didn't have to worry about it not performing in certain situations.

- low light
- overheating
- full frame
- etc

so [[the best basketball shoe is the one you forget that you are wearing]] , similarly to him, fx3 was the best buy for him because it didn't affect his workflow.
