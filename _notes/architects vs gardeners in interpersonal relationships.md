title: architects vs gardeners in interpersonal relationships
---
this was inspired by [[Linking Your Thinking with Nick Milo â€“ This Secret Principle Will Transform Your Notes]] in his comments section.


`Thanks for the talk. It made me think of the dynamics in a relationship. My spouse tends strongly toward architect. I tend strongly toward gardener. It leads us to take on certain roles. It will be interesting to discuss.`

  

`You've hit on such an important topic of interpersonal relationships where the A&G framework is greatly under-appreciated. It's so helpful there. While partners may each have strengths, if the shared dynamic forces one party to always compensate for the other (an Architect having to always organize for a Gardener), then awareness can help balance things out from time to time. Conversely, if Architects are overly organized, or strict with schedule, or planning every aspect of a trip, it can stifle the creative spirit a Gardener enjoys (and perhaps needs).`
