welcome to ***fomties™***, which is a stylised version of the phrase figuring out my twenties.
it is also the fancy name i gave to this side project of mine.

this is my little corner of the internet where i share my ideas and thoughts in public. this is also known as digital gardening or a form of learning in public.

the site has a diverse ecosystem of interlinked notes evolving at very different rates. most of the notes fall within these topics i'm interested in, but the most common attribute between all of these notes is the fact that they will always be a work in progress, regardless of how evolved they appear.

this project is built upon a couple of my values i hold dearly to.

so these notes are written for myself to aid my thinking, learning and creativity.
