rewrite the concept better

warming up

setting up bujoÂ 

donâ€™t get caught in [[productive procrastination]] or inaction

show your work by austin klein

i have an adjacent idea or i think it somehow relates to... i can't verbalise it at the moment

the idea here i want to share is about how it is necessary to spend time preparing in order for smooth work to be done, the idea of [[systems over templates]] but at the same time, there is also a lot of conflict with productive procrastination.

when we talk about [[daily mvp]] and [[speed over perfection]] in the [[onboarding bible]] i was taken through, you can start to see how there is this grey area as to what is considered sufficient or enough before taking action.
