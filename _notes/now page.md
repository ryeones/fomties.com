title: now page

a now page is similar to that of an about page that you see on most websites, however there is a twist to it. about page tends to be set in stone, static page, which tells it audience about what the site is or what the creator of the site does. a now page adds a twist to your site by allowing your followers to sneak a peak into what youâ€™re focusing on in life at every moment in time. it is meant to be kept as updated as possible, or at least at consistent time intervals.

derek siver popularised the now page, and gregory brown pushed for a [now movement](https://sive.rs/nowff) in which [many people online](http://nownownow.com) with a website have also included a now page. here is his article about how the rationale and how it first began.
