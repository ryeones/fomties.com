title: rule of 3 losses
---
the idea of when to cut loses and not go on an entire tilt.

this idea first stemmed from my long history since young of gaming.

just a quick little story. 

my dad was always pretty strict growing up. 

study hard. exercise. gaming is a waste of time.

this soon led to me yearning to game. the idea of how the more you restrain something, it becomes more enterable.

long story short, i was hooked.

and every loss made me want to win it back.

this eventually resulted in losing streaks, raging moments and tilting into the wee hours of the night.

the rule of 3 losses is simple.

after 3 losses, pause. regardless.

over time, i have adapted this rule slightly.

for example on days i want to play more, it would be 3 consecutive losses.

but overtime what i realised is that 3 losses regardless, was the best for my mental health as well as in game progression. 

and that‚Äôs something i still try to stick to.

3 losses. followed by a 30 minute break at a minimum.

this should be applied to other areas in life as well.

for example when i was studying in architecture school.

after 3 ‚Äúlosses‚Äù when i‚Äôm ideating as part of a project, take a 30 minute break.

of course in this case, the losses may not be as clear cut as a 3 minute game in brawl stars or a 45 minute game in dota.

so set your own rules. but make sure to stick to them.

over time, these set rules will help you get through tough times and actually progress you further.

as the famous saying goes, you do not rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems.
