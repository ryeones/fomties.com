title: creative constraints
---

i first heard about a similar term from a blog post by [[Steph Ango]] called [style is consistent constraint](https://stephango.com/style) and i started looking back at my life, and realised that this isn't something completely new.

in fact, i've been applying this concept in various aspects of my life. it all stems from my belief of [[systems over templates]], as well as in the recent years going through architecture school itself.

every design project has a brief, with constraints and limitations, and what i realised over the 4 years in architecture school was that our creativity and problem solving skills arise not solely base on our ability as an architect or designer, but instead is heavily influenced by the presence of creative constraints.
