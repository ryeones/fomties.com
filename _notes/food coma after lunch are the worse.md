is there any work around for it?

perhaps coffee?

also made me think how i would structure my own startup or business in the future. 

i see how people enter work at 9, or for some work it may only require coming by 10. for the first hour, not much work is done, going to the pantry etc and soon after starting on a little bit of work, it will be time for an hour of lunch from 12 or 1.

after lunch itself, food coma hits and for the next two hours its when un productivity really kicks in. and by the time you get back on track and want to have some work done, it’ll be about an hour or so left before it’s time clock off.

i would probably structure, assuming its a smaller team, even in the case of having to “work” longer hours, i would prefer something similar to the military structure, where we get up early, lead a healthy lifestyle together, so maybe doing some kind of work out or activity as this also helps build comrnddarie.

still early in the morning, we will get into work mode, refreshed and ready to start since technically our day had already began a couple of hours ago.

have lunch together and doing the [[food coma]] period, it should be swapped out for more admin related tasks or even perhaps something that doesn’t actually require concentration at all. after that period then we can get back to doing our work.

honestly this makes me thing, if in the future i do have something of my own and want to hire people, do i really want a remote or partial work set up? at my current job, i don’t see the real use of having working in the co working space, besides on mondays where physical meetings wiht the whole team are set up.

i would say it would probably be more effective if 3 out of the 5 days are work from home, or maybe even mostly work from home, with the occasional physical space when meetings or discussions are required.
