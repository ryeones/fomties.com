i wrote this in my journal on the `2025-09-03`, it was regarding how missing a longer form journal entry the previous day would normally throw me off my course, resulting in either forging the next few days or the entire habit itself.

i think the goal has to be the input rather than what the eventual output is, especially at the beginning when starting out. and as good as it is to be consistent everyday with maximum capacity, i think deciding on an [[daily mvp]], similar to that in startups and business, the idea of testing fast and adapting.

even what my company stands for in the [[onboarding bible]], is that speed over perfection (i may have paraphrased this alittle). having a daily minimum viable product, in the case of my journal being the daily one liners and habit trackers, that would keep my in [[flow]] and continue to instil the habit.
