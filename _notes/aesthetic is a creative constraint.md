title: aesthetic is a creative constraint
---
https://stephango.com/style

this was the original writing that i feel that was very insightful, 
and something i always wanted to verbalise but failure to get it out of my head. soon enough i formulated it to be [[creative constraints]]

here are some of my own constraints i want to abide by in various contexts.

general folder management at a very top level.

+sources - these are references of otherâ€™s work
atlas dots
atlas maps
atlas works
calendar compass
calendar notes
calendar logs
effort notes

01 personal - these are things related to my personal life and brand 
02 agency - these are things related to my side projects, companies iâ€™m building, basically things bigger than my entity 
03 freelance - these are things from one off projects, or freelance stuff, and even 9-5 related basically when iâ€™m working for others.
04 assets - these are general assets that can be useful
05 archive - these are things i no longer intend to use 

x - these are files and assets

in each folder, i try to have minimal sub folders - admin, templates/sops, 

tags and naming systems

i use yyyy-mm-dd everywhere

in general use pluralise tags, for example people not person so that i donâ€™t have to think of which to use

brand/company_title_version number

colours

this is my personal brand colours. essentially what i like to keep as much as possible

i like the colour blue, but in general, monochromatic with minimal logos or loud designs.

not to use black and white, but off colors like 333333 and faf4e5

pastel in nature

writing & typography 

i like having one san serif font, serif font, and one handwritten font

fonts - helvetical neue ltd std bold, apple garamond, lazydog

i like typing in lowercase, firstly its easier, and forces me to write in a structure and way that still seems readable.

i use markdown and wysiwyg interchangeably 

i use plain text and markdown files for all my writing 

i write concise essays, less than 500 words

life

i have a hair cut every 1-2 months
i shave every 3 days at a maximum

reviews

i ask myself 40 questions every year
i do daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly reviews.
i do 16 personality test, ikigai every 3-6 months just to keep myself in check

filming

i shoot things on my phone first, this gives me creative constraint. 

hereâ€™s a collection of interesting personal style choices iâ€™ve enjoyed.

* Scott Yu-JanÂ paints all his tools white.
* 2yntheticÂ uses aÂ limited palette for outfitsÂ andÂ office decor.
* Johnny DecimalÂ is a system to organize digital data.
* Casey NeistatÂ labels everythingÂ in his studioÂ with paint markers.
* Ryan HooverÂ never changes his profile picture.
* Wes Anderson usesÂ the typeface FuturaÂ in many of his films.
* Steve JobsÂ wore the same Issey Miyake black turtleneck and New Balance 991 shoes every day.
* George R.R. Martin writes his novels on the 40 year old DOS operating system
* Beethoven always counted exactly 60 coffee beans to make coffee, especially for visitors.
* Jesper Kouthoofd ofÂ Teenage EngineeringÂ only uses lowercaseÂ because uppercase communicates too much authority
* Osvaldo Cavandoli created the cartoonÂ La LineaÂ using an animated white line, colored backgrounds, and unintelligible vocalizations
