title: huh, so what is this
---
uhh haha good question.

its just an informal website,

a playground for my thoughts,

an archive, maybe even a blog, whatever.

this is mainly for documenting and sharing -

my two favourite hobbies, aside from many others.

no page here will ever be fully complete,

it will never be actually.

this is a space for imperfection and endless refinement ,

rawness and abstraction.

a place for communication with myself,

and for those who stumble across them,

and typos and sentences that end with no resolution,

and of course, lower caps

if you canâ€™t tell.

at the moment, iâ€™m championing for light mode,

iâ€™ll question our friendship if you actually use dark mode (and android)

but just know that a couple months ago i favoured dark over light.

and of course, i like lower caps,

pastel colours, and emojis as well.

but at the same time, iâ€™m a minimalist at heart

- black and white,

nothing too extravagant.

this page could evolve too

i might wake up one day and decide i donâ€™t want anyone reading this

and delete it all.

but i might also wake up one day,

and notion changes their terms of service

or developers no longer maintain this code ðŸ˜­

who knows, even i donâ€™t lol.

there might have been more things on here that i removed

because it was just a little too private for it to be in public

or it could just be the first time iâ€™m writing anything here.

(its not, definitely not)

or iâ€™m just making room for the mystery and possibility of all of the above

everything on this site is a work in progress

everything is a trial and error

i am not a writer, i canâ€™t write for nuts

but i am a thinker, and problem solver.

i think deeply, and reflect on everything that i come across

no matter how big or small it may seem

i just like seeing where things can go

thank u for being here

dm me if u have any thoughts.
