this was mentioned multiple times in my onboarding bible for [[seek sophie]], and it is something they hammer quite a lot on. however on a deeper level, i think this is also an interesting concept that can be related to [[creative constraints]] and [[aesthetic is a creative constraint]] or something along the lines. 

it gives me the idea of how onboarding sequences, sops, documenting is so important.
